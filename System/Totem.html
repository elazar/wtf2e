<blockquote>
<h2>TOTEM (• TO •••••)</h2>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Your character has a relationship to a totem spirit, either personally or to a pack totem. Each dot invested in this Merit adds a totem point to create the totem (see p. 91). Note that any character can only have five points in this Merit. A pack totem is limited by the number of pack members, but can be massive with enough invested members. The Totem Merit also adds dice equal to its dots to any Social action with the totem spirit in question.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback</strong>: Being tied to a totem leaves a character beholden to the totem. If your character angers the totem, the invested totem points fade. This may require the pack to re-negotiate their totem advantage. The points can return if your character makes reparations with the totem, but must be re-purchased.</p>
