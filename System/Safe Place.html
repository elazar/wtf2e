<h2>SAFE PLACE (• TO •••••)</h2>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Your character has somewhere she can go where she can feel secure. While she may have enemies that could attack her there, she’s prepared and has the upper hand. The dot rating reflects the security of the place. The actual location, the luxury,and the size are represented by equipment. A one-dot Safe Place might be equipped with basic security systems or a booby trap at the windows and door. A five-dot bolthole could have a security crew, infrared scanners at every entrance, or trained dogs. Each place could be an apartment, a mansion, or a hidey-hole.</p>
<p>Unlike most Merits, multiple characters can contribute dots to a single Safe Place, combining their points into something greater. A Safe Place gives an Initiative bonus equal to the Merit dots should the location come under attack. The bonus only applies to a character with dots invested in the Safe Place.</p>
<p>Any efforts to breach the Safe Place suffer a penalty equal to the Merit dots invested. If the character desires, the Safe Place can include traps that cause lethal damage to intruders equal to a maximum of the Merit rating (player’s choice as to how much damage a given trap inflicts). This requires that the character has at least a dot in Crafts. The traps may be avoided with a Dexterity + Larceny roll, penalized by the Safe Place dots.</p>
