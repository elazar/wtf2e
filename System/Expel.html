<p>&quot;Pack Rites,&quot; p. 146:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>EXPEL (••••)</h1>
<p>This rite lays spiritual claim to a person or object with the pack’s bond, forcing a possessing spirit out.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols</strong>: Ownership, dominance, shattering, scourging</p>
<p><strong>Sample Rite</strong>: The Iminir ritemaster screams in rage and punches the man in the face. As he staggers back, the rest of the pack piles on. In a few moments, they’ve wrapped him in clattering chains. As he thrashes and shouts, the ritemaster punches him again and rakes her claws across his cheeks. She ignores the spitting, cursing, and crying as she uses the drawn blood to mark him with her pack’s sigils of ownership, gives him one final punch, and commands him to shut the hell up. The rest of the pack tear away the bindings that hold his body; as the chains break, so does the spirit’s hold on him. (Presence + Intimidate)</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Extended (10 successes; 1 roll per minute); con- tested by the spirit’s Resistance</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The rite targets a spirit that is possessing a human or object. If the rite reaches the target number of successes before the spirit does, it forcibly breaks the spirit’s fetter or possession. If the spirit possessed a living creature, as a side effect that creature is considered a pack member for the next hour. Expel has no effect against the Claimed; the spirit’s synthesis has dug too deeply into flesh.</p>
