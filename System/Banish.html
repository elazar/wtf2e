<blockquote>
<p>This rite invokes the pack's authority as guardians between the two worlds, casting intruders out from realms to which they do not belong.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols</strong>: Warning, the two worlds, the Wolf's last howl, bitterness</p>
<p><strong>Sample Rite</strong>: A growing trend amongst North American Uratha is a subtle invocation of banishment, where the ritemaster warns the interloper and challenges them with paradoxical demands. During the rite, the ritemaster chews on a paste of bitter berries, spitting it out to daub sigils of warding and the two worlds. Whatever answer is given by the spirit is wrong by its very nature, and the ritemaster's mocking howl chases it across the Gauntlet. (Manipulation + Subterfuge)</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Extended (5 successes; each roll represents 1 minute); spirits may contest with their Resistance, but other creatures cannot resist</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: This rite banishes a targeted spirit from the physical world into Shadow, or a creature in the Shadow that is not a spirit or werewolf to the world of Flesh. The banished creature appears at the corresponding point in its appropriate realm.</p>
<p>There are reports that this rite also works on Wound-tainted spirit servants of the dread Maeljin if conducted in the Wound in question, pushing them out of the Shadow and into somewhere else beyond the Uratha's ken.</p>
