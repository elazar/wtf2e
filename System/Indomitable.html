<h2>INDOMITABLE (••)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Resolve •••</p>
<p>Your character possesses an iron will. The powers of the supernatural have little bearing on her behavior. She can stand up to Lunacy, a witch's charms, or a ghost's gifts of fright. Any time a supernatural creature uses a power to influence your character's thoughts or emotions, add +2 dice to the dice pool to contest it. If the roll is resisted, instead subtract -2 dice from the monster's dice pool. Note that this only affects mental influence and manipulation from a supernatural origin. A werewolf with a remarkable Manipulation + Persuasion score is just as likely to convince your character to do something using mundane tricks.</p>
