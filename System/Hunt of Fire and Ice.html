<blockquote>
<h2>HUNT OF FIRE AND ICE (WISDOM)</h2>
<p>The blazing sun and the chill of ice both sap the strength of the prey, leaving them weakened and desperate for sanctuary from the elements.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 5 Essence</p>
<p><strong>Dice Pool</strong>: Intelligence + Occult + Wisdom</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents 1 minute)</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour per success</p>
<h3>Roll Results</h3>
<p><strong>Dramatic Failure</strong>: The Uratha gains the Ban Condition. He must carry a source of extreme heat or cold about him at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: The Uratha accumulates no successes and gains the Stumbled Condition.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The Uratha accumulates successes. If the target is met, then the local area is rapidly subjected to either the Extreme Cold or Extreme Heat Environmental Tilt, depending on its normal clime. Hunt of Fire and Ice affects an area with radius of up to the Uratha’s Wisdom Renown in miles.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptional Success</strong>: The sheer heat or cold works against the werewolf’s prey in other ways. A human fleeing the Uratha finds that the engine of a car has frozen and refuses to start; a desperately thirsty character finds that a water supply has spoiled.</p>
