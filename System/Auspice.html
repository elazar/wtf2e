<p>Determined by whatever phase of the moon was out the night you changed.</p>
<h1>Rahu</h1>
<p><strong>Phase</strong>: full moon</p>
<p>Warrior, leader, absolute tidal wave of destruction. The combat machine of combat machines, these guys are focused on dealing the final blow to the prey, and making sure the prey knows exactly who and what is after it. They lead the charge because it's their duty. They revel in being seen, not for glory like the Cahalith, but just for the thrill of the Hunt and the rush and the power of it all. And while the Elodoth may be a law guy, the Rahu cling to the Oath of the Moon, and follow it with every heartbeat. They have the ability to see who the weakest member in a group is.</p>
<h1>Irraka</h1>
<p><strong>Phase</strong>: new moon</p>
<p>The stalker, the assassin, the tester. The one who hunts in the shadows and drives the prey towards the rest of the pack so they can finish it off. The one who is constantly testing people, objects, relationships, etc. to see how well they hold up. The one who studies her pack mates and mentally takes notes on how to kill them. The one who you will never see coming, and that's perfect. They have the ability to move ahead or behind a target in initiative, do better than most in conversations, etc.</p>
<h1>Ithaeur</h1>
<p><strong>Phase</strong>: crescent moon</p>
<p>The spirit expert, shaman, mystic. The one whose job revolves around the spiritual, because the Spirit affects the Flesh and vice versa. The Elodoth may make connections with spirits, but the Ithaeur has studied exactly what you need to do and say to appease the spirit before you can talk to it, and can make those connections as well if need be. When on the Hunt they can let out a warning howl telling all lesser spirits to stay away from the prey, or face a werewolf's wrath. The cost for learning rituals (which can do things from banish a spirit to marking territory to sending a message across far distances, and more) is also halved for these guys.</p>
<h1>Elodoth</h1>
<p><strong>Phase</strong>: half moon</p>
<p>The law keeper, the diplomat, the connections guy, the judge. The one who must keep balance in the pack, they are experts at forming connections and making deals both in the Flesh and spirit, and making sure all is fair and balanced. They are also willing to sacrifice those connections in the name of the Hunt, doing what is necessary to bring the prey down. They have the nice ability of being able to force a pack mate into Basu-Im or bring them out of it.</p>
<h1>Cahalith</h1>
<p><strong>Phase</strong>: gibbous moon</p>
<p>The storyteller, the bard, the dreamer. These ones see the Hunt as worthy of a story, and their attitude when on the Hunt proves it. They are loud, boisterous, willing to leave witnesses to tell others just how awesome the pack is. They are also chosen to have vivid dreams granted to them by Mother Luna, which can foretell events to come.</p>
