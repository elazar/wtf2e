<h2>SACRED HUNT (••)</h2>
<p>The Sacred Hunt, the <em>Siskur-Dah</em>, is the most holy of all rites. Many werewolves believe that it draws upon the laws of the hunt that the Wolf-Mother herself personified.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols</strong>: The hunt, prey, claws or weapons, blood</p>
<p><strong>Sample Rite</strong>: Blood Talon ritemasters commonly use a circling dance of participants, with the Urathas' claws marked with blood or ash. The ritemaster wears a mask representing the intended prey, and what follows is a mock-hunt around the dancing circle as the ritemaster seeks to break free. (Dexterity + Athletics)</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents 1 minute)</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The rite binds hunters and prey into the Siskur-Dah. All werewolves present are cast as the hunters. The ritemaster must indicate the intended prey during the rite, which can be an individual or a group, but they do not need to be identified with precise details or names.</p>
<p>The rite has three effects:</p>
<p>All participating werewolves gain the <em>Siskur-Dah</em> Condition.</p>
<p>If the Uratha bring down a spirit that is the prey of this rite, they may divide its remaining Essence amongst themselves as they see fit; this can be used to destroy a spirit by draining all its Essence and discorporating it, but doing so is usually a breaking point toward Spirit and is seen as disrespectful if done without good reason.</p>
<p>If the Uratha chase down spirit-prey that knows the symbols of a rite or can carve the secret of a Gift, any Uratha hunter present can expend the necessary Experiences to be marked with the Gift or learn the rite from the spirit. If this is done, the hunters do not get any Essence if they then bring the spirit down, and doing so is a breaking point toward Spirit.</p>

<h1>Condition</h1>
<p>p. 310</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>SISKUR-DAH (PERSISTENT)</h2>
<p>Your character is on the <em>Siskur-Dah</em>, the Sacred Hunt. She gains a specific benefit depending on the ritemaster's tribe.</p>
<p>The Blood Talon Sacred Hunt grants your character the ability to perceive the Renown brands of werewolf prey. She can see them as a clear silver glow (or a fiery red for Pure) and can read the prey's value in each Renown with a reflexive action.</p>
<p>The Bone Shadow Sacred Hunt grants your character the ability to touch and strike ephemeral entities nominated as prey with her natural weapons.</p>
<p>The Hunter in Darkness Sacred Hunt grants your character the ability to sense the state of the Gauntlet in your presence; you are constantly aware of its current strength and if it has been increased or decreased compared to its normal strength; if the hunt's prey is responsible then you know this. You can also sense any other breaches in reality that your prey has moved through in the last lunar month — gateways to places and realms other than the Shadow.</p>
<p>The Iron Master Sacred Hunt grants your character the ability to choose which of the Lunacy Conditions she inflicts on humans while hunting the prey.</p>
<p>The Storm Lord Sacred Hunt grants your character the ability to clearly perceive prey that is possessed, Urged, or Claimed. If your character looks at a Ridden human who is the prey of the hunt, for example, she will see the spirit coiled up within him.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Sources</strong>: The Sacred Hunt rite, or being personally blessed by a Firstborn.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: The prey is brought down (a kill is not necessary) or the pack breaks off the <em>Siskur-Dah</em> by taking any significant actions towards ends other than the hunt.</p>
<p><strong>Beat</strong>: Your character achieves an exceptional success on an action involving the prey.</p>
