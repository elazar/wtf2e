<h2>FEET OF MIST (CUNNING)</h2>
<p>Sometimes, the hunter becomes the hunted. When an Uratha with this Facet is the quarry, all trace of her passing simply disappears. She might as well not exist.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Essence</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Instant</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour</p>
<p>For the duration of the Facet, all attempts to track or locate the Uratha fail. She leaves no tracks, no device can give up her location, and even the Gifts and divinations of the most powerful supernatural hunters falter. When Feet of Mist causes a Clash of Wills against another supernatural power that would track or locate her, the werewolf benefits from the rote quality on her Clash of Wills dice pool. The Facet does not make her invisible, however â€” she can be perceived normally by anyone who comes across her.</p>
