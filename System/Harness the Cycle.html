<blockquote>
<p>The cycle of the changing seasons bears immense power. This rite compels spirits of the seasons to give up a tithe of the burgeoning Essence that they gorge themselves on as the world turns.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols</strong>: The season, consumption, blood, earth or sky</p>
<p><strong>Sample Rite</strong>: It's a common rite repeated across the world; come harvest time and the Autumn equinox, the pack comes together to celebrate the time of plenty. They feast on freshly killed meat, mark themselves with the fertile earth and howl to the sky as the fire burns late into the night. They share with each other the bounty of the season, and paint themselves with the blood of the kill to show their prosperity. (Presence + Socialize)</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents half an hour)</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: This rite draws Essence from the changing of the seasons. In temperate regions, it can only be performed on the seasonal equinoxes and solstices. All Uratha participating in the rite gain a bounty of Essence equal to half their maximum Essence pool. Humans and Wolf-Blooded regain all spent Willpower and heal at twice the normal rate for a full month.</p>
<p>In tropical regions, the rite is performed on the two days that mark the turnings between wet and dry seasons. Uratha gain enough Essence to fill their entire Essence pool. Humans and Wolf-Blooded gain the same benefits as above, but also gain a single dot in Allies, Contacts or Resources for a full month.</p>
