<h2>MENTOR (• TO •••••)</h2>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: This Merit gives your character a teacher who provides advice and guidance. He acts on your character's Merits behalf, often in the background and sometimes without your character's knowledge. This may be an older werewolf in the same protectorate, a lodge-mate, or other figure. While Mentors can be highly competent, they almost always want something in return for their services. The dot rating determines the Mentor's capabilities, and to what extent he'll aid your character.</p>
<p>When establishing a Mentor, determine what the Mentor wants from your character. The dot rating chosen should reflect the importance of the objective to him. A one-dot Mentor might always be on the Siskur-Dah, and wants to live vicariously through your character. This might mean coming to him and telling stories of your character's exploits. A five-dot Mentor would want something beyond price, such as an oath to find and kill the idigam that murdered the rest of his pack.</p>
<p>Choose three Skills the Mentor possesses. You can substitute Resources for one of these Skills. Once per session, the character may ask her Mentor for a favor. The favor must involve one of those Skills or be within the scope of his Resources. The Mentor commits to the favor (often asking for a commensurate favor in return); and if a roll is required on the Mentor's part to secure the favor, he is automatically considered to have successes equal to his dot rating. Alternately, the player may ask the Storyteller to have the Mentor act on her character's behalf, without her character knowing or initiating the request.</p>
