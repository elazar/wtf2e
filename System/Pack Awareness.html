<h2>PACK AWARENESS (WISDOM)</h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: None or 1 Essence</p>
<p>This Facet grants the Uratha a permanent general sense of where each of her packmates is in relation to herself, as well as his or her general state and wellbeing. The effects reach up to a range of her Wisdom Renown in miles. She cannot be surprised by any enemy that any of her packmates are aware of, making it extremely hard to ambush her when she is with her pack. Finally, the Uratha may spend 1 Essence to speak mind-to-mind with any packmate she can see for one scene.</p>

<p>I asked on <a href="../Sessions/2022-07-03.html">2022-07-03</a> regarding whether this ability can cross the Gauntlet. It's wordly vaguely, but because it specifies a range in miles, we're assuming it cannot do so.</p>
