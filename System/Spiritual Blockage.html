<h2>SPIRITUAL BLOCKAGE (••)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wisdom ••, Brawl •, Occult •••, Wits •••</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Your character can sense the ebb and flow of Essence in her opponents. With well-placed strikes, she can curb the flow of Essence in the body, denying a victim access to his spiritual fuel. You can choose to use Spiritual Blockage any time your character makes a Brawl or Weaponry attack against a creature that uses Essence. Make an attack with a –2 penalty. If the attack deals damage, the victim loses a point of Essence; on an exceptional success the victim loses two points. This Essence is considered spent, not lost. As such, it limits the amount a victim can spend in a turn.</p>
