<blockquote>
<h2>CONTROLLED BURN (••)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Resolve •••, Composure •••</p>
<p>Effect: Your character suffers from a dampened form of Wasu-Im, the first stage of Death Rage. When she goes into Wasu-Im, she shifts to Hishu or Urhan form, not Dalu or Urshul. If she succeeds in getting a turn of lucidity (see p. 102), she can spend a point of Willpower to shrug the Rage off entirely.</p>
<p>Drawback: Your character can only change to those two forms in Wasu-Im, which could cause complications that could push her toward Basu-Im.</p>
