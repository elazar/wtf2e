<blockquote>
<p>Your character is Wise. She seeks the intelligent, reasoned answer in all things. She looks to past successes and failures, and those successes and failures of others so as to take a smarter course of action. This inspires others to challenge her wisdom, and question her foundation of knowledge. Any rolls to defy or question her advice gain +2 dice. When she’s proven her reason sound, she’s redoubled in her understanding of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Sources</strong>: Flaring Wisdom Renown brands with Essence.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Once at least one individual has used the +2 bonus, you may choose to shed this Condition to add your character’s Wisdom Renown in automatic successes to any Investigation, Medicine, or Occult action, even if she rolls no successes.</p>
<p><strong>Beat</strong>: n/a</p>
