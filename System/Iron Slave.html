<p>&quot;Shadow Gifts &gt; Gift of Technology,&quot; p. 134:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>IRON SLAVE (WISDOM)</h1>
<p>This Facet forces even snarling beasts of iron and gears to heel and to bear the Urathaâ€™s spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Essence</p>
<p><strong>Dice Pool</strong>: Wits + Crafts + Wisdom</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Instant</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 scene</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Facet can be used on a single mechanical vehicle or other piece of significant engineering (such as a crane, production line, or similar) that the Uratha can see.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Roll Results</h2>
<p><strong>Dramatic Failure</strong>: The Uratha gains the Ban Condition. She wishes to venerate machines of the type targeted, and will try to lay offerings to their spirits or paint them with glyphs that honor them.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: The Facet fails.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The Uratha immerses her senses into the ma- chine, and is able to perceive its surroundings. She can allow the machine or vehicle to continue its operation as normal, or can directly take control of it. While riding the machine, she has only the vaguest perception with her own senses and appears to be in a daze or sleeping. Returning to her own senses takes an instant action and ends the Facet. Should the vehicle or machine be destroyed while the Uratha is riding it, she is ejected back into her own body and treats it as a breaking point towards Spirit. If the Uratha dies while she is riding, the fragment of her spirit becomes subsumed into the machine and may create a unique and bizarre Claimed.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptional Success</strong>: The Uratha remains fully aware of her own surroundings.</p>
