<p>Specializes in a certain kind of prey that werewolves have because they believe that type is the most dangerous.</p>
<h1>Storm Lords</h1>
<p>The Storm Lords consider themselves not just the descendants of Father Wolf, but his heirs. They are the best of the best. Their initiation rites are brutal ones. But if you can weather the storm and the cold, you are considered one of them. Their favored prey are the Urged and the Claimed, which is what happens when a spirit either starts influencing a human, or when a spirit and a human merge into something unholy. They will be the leaders, the supporting structure that the others need. They must be strong for their fellow werewolves, and that is why their Tribal Oath is &quot;Allow no one to witness or tend your weakness.&quot; Their patron is Skolis-Ur, the Winter Wolf.</p>
<h1>Iron Masters</h1>
<p>The Iron Masters are the ones who live among humans with the most ease, and as such, have human and other species who masquerade as humans, like vampires and such, as their favored prey. Humans don't look as deadly as the other kinds of prey, but this Tribe knows better. Their Tribal Oath is &quot;Honor your territory in all things&quot; - in other words, be willing to change your territory and keep it safe for the greater good. Their patron is Sangrim-Ur, Red Wolf.</p>
<h1>Hunters in Darkness</h1>
<p>The Hunters in Darkness are the ones who see the Hunt as always ongoing. They are married to the job. They are always strategizing the next move, keeping watch over their territory. Their favored prey are the Hosts, shards of ancient animal demon-gods who can inhabit humans and puppeteer them, prey that eluded even Father Wolf. Their Tribal Oath is &quot;Let no sacred place in your territory be violated.&quot; In general this means that your territory should be kept safe and clean of intruders. Your territory is sacred. Their patron is Haikon-Ur, Black Wolf.</p>
<h1>Bone Shadows</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Shadows#Culture">Bone Shadows</a> are the mystics, occultists, secret keepers and seekers of knowledge. They deal in spirits, and spend their whole lives finding out stuff. Unsurprisingly, their favored prey are spirits. Their Tribal Oath is &quot;Pay each spirit in kind.&quot; They know the idea of give and take very well. Their patron is Kamaduis-Ur, or Death Wolf.</p>
<h1>Blood Talons</h1>
<p>The Blood Talons are your warrior tribe. Their favored prey is other werewolves - ranging from the Pure to Bale Hounds to other Forsaken who have broken the law. Their Tribal Oath is &quot;Offer no surrender you would not accept.&quot; The Talons are the ones who teach that if a dispute comes up between your tribe and your pack, you side with your pack every time. Them fighting other werewolves does make outsiders wary of them, since it is in the law that &quot;The People do not murder the People,&quot; but the Talons have learned to take the hits to their Harmony for the greater good. Their patron is Fenris-Ur, the Destroyer Wolf.</p>
