<blockquote>
<h1>SHADOWBIND (•••)</h1>
<p>With this rite, the ritemaster seeks to bind a spirit in a weave of ancient law that it cannot easily pierce.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols</strong>: Cage, binding, a key, the spirit’s type</p>
<p><strong>Sample Rite</strong>: Iron Masters in industrial cities often bind spirits of electricity and information. The old methods involve circles of wire with sigil-scribed copper keys dangled like the lure of freedom. These days, modern Farsil Luhal buttress their rites with radio emitters that squeal and warble at occult frequencies, making a wall of repulsing sound around the spirit. (Intelligence + Science)</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents 1 minute); potentially contested by the spirit’s Resistance</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong>: The rite targets a single spirit that is present on the same side of the Gauntlet. The participants must define a binding space that the spirit is currently within. If the rite reaches the target number of successes before the spirit does, then the spirit can no longer leave the binding space, cannot cross the Gauntlet and cannot use any of its Numina against targets beyond the space. The spirit cannot break free unless the ritemaster verbally releases it, an outside force breaks the binding space’s border, or someone outside the space fulfils a specific condition expressed by the ritemaster. The ritemaster must tell at least two others of how to break the binding within an hour of the ritual, or the power fades and the spirit goes free.</p>
