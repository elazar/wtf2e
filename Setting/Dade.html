<h1>Making a Hunter</h1>
<p>p. 28-29</p>
<h2>1. Who was he before the First Change?</h2>
<p>Dade's father Michael disappeared before he was old enough to know him well or understand the significance of his departure. His mother Lauren worked long hours to support them both, so he spent a lot of time by himself. His father left behind little in the way of possessions, but among them were some books and papers of an arcane and occult nature. Dade dedicated a good deal of his time to attempting to decipher them, doing research online and sometimes visiting local libraries. What little knowledge he managed to glean about them was not enough to suggest that he would experience the Change.</p>
<h2>2. What happened during the First Change?</h2>
<p>One night, while walking home from another library trip, Dade encountered a spirit who took the form of his father. Confused, but hoping he'd stumbled upon something meaningful in his pursuit, he followed the spirit. After luring him to a secluded alley, the spirit attempted to Claim Dade; in response, Dade's body underwent the First Change.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, a random passerby entered the alley to find Dade with his back turned and mistook him for an easy mark. Calling after Dade to relinquish his wallet, the man soon dropped his knife in horror when Dade turned to reveal his new form. The blade had no sooner hit the ground than Dade was on his would-be assailant, and the barest of screams escaped the man's lips before Dade ripped him to shreds.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the area surrounding Dade was predominantly blighted and uninhabited; his First Change had no other formerly living casualties.</p>
<h2>3. What was the first spirit he mastered?</h2>
<p>Dade destroyed the spirit who attempted to Claim him, though he has only fragmented memories of the event. The spirit's attempt to masquerade as his father was one of its few traits that Dade can recall. He's uncertain what repercussions, if any, his destruction of the spirit may have in the future.</p>
<h2>4. Does his pack listen to him?</h2>
<p>The Pack tends to look to Dade more in situations involving spirits. However, outside of such situations, he doesn't tend to speak much, and the Pack has learned to heed his words in the rare instance that he does voice them.</p>
<h2>5. What spirits does he fear?</h2>
<p>While he has no direct proof or experiences on which to base his suspicions, Dade suspects that the belongings left behind by his father suggest that he is dead and that a spirit was the reason he met his demise. Since his First Change, nightmares of a vague but dark and powerful being have plagued him. While he does fear this spirit, he feels he has little choice in pursuing it if he is ever to discover the truth behind his father's disappearance.</p>
