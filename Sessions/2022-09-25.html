<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>It's Sunday evening.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> discovers that it's impossible to treat the sort of long-term Lunacy that <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> has. Practically, the best non-supernatural thing to do is to treat it like PTSD. In supernatural terms, bringing him to a peaceful place in the Hisil may have a positive effect. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> resolves to pass this information along to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> when the opportunity presents itself.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> travel to the church of <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> to consult with the Pack's mole in the church, <a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a>. Aside from a change in the color of his robes, he looks the same. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gestures to lead him into an alley near the church.
<ul>
<li>He managed to find and get inside <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>'s residence. It's a dive bar called &quot;The Last Firstborn&quot; (with a faded first &quot;r&quot;) near the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>'s territory. The outside is free of glass and metal. The inside is guarded by a rather large bouncer. The patrons seemed antagonized.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a> managed to get into the bar's basement, which serves as <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> bedroom. It's surrounded by what appear to be holy books, and there's a podium nearby. There's an adjacent room that he wasn't able to enter.</li>
<li>For the most part, <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> goes between this bar and the church. Beyond that, her travels and calendar are rather mundane in nature. <a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a> noticed her carrying a few vials on her person at some point, but couldn't ascertain what was in them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> asks <a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a> if he has a phone, but he indicates that they aren't allowed at worship and he left his at home. She provides him with her phone number and demands that he provide her with any contact information he has for members of the cult.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> urges him to attempt to discover more information about <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>: the nature of the vials she carries, the purpose of the room adjacent to her own, etc. <a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a> suspects that the Pack will reveal themselves to the cult and asks when they intend to do so. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> responds that they must learn the Sister's true nature first.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> to check in, and they agree to meet with the Pack at HQ to chat.</li>
<li>Once the Pack arrives at HQ, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> asks about the last time they heard from <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>, saying that they didn't seem themself at the time. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> indicates they are aware of the cause of their split personalities, but seems unsure of whether it's to be considered a problem, or if it will continue. They don't seem it's likely to expose them as Uratha, or to endanger them.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> indicates that their own Pack has some issues being worked through, and it's taken their presence from the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> fills <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> in about <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>, <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, <a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a>. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> seems prone to a more violent solution. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> suggests trying to bribe someone from the police to take care of the Sister; <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> points out that they lack a police contact and sufficient money to incentivize one.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> confesses to having been in contact with the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a>. She indicates that they seem disorganized, not well-informed, and recently had a &quot;rat&quot; situation at their HQ. She believes they may be able to help the Pack with their <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> problem. After getting the Pack's consensus, she texts the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a>, indicates that she has a lead, and asks when they can meet.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> confesses that she recently discovered her brother <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a> is Wolf-Blooded, and that she's conflicted about whether or not to tell him. The Pack resolves to contact <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>, as he has several of them in his employ, to get a better idea of what to expect so that <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> can be prepared to answer questions when she does tell him.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> confesses to having had a recent unsettling conversation with some Pure, among them <a href="../Setting/Julian Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>, that develops into a rant about his rather Darwinian view of existence.</li>
<li>In the midst of the rant, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> receives a text back from <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> and says they have a lead as well. The two resolve to meet on Tuesday to exchange information. The gathering is apparently to be something of a celebration of sorts that the cell will fill her in on later.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> suddenly senses that someone from their Pack has died, and falls to the ground, then shortly after stands back up in a rage and marches out of HQ, snarling that someone is &quot;about to have their legs ripped off and be beaten to death with them.&quot; <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> gives a half-hearted &quot;Good luck.&quot; <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> responds brightly by saying &quot;Thanks!&quot; before shifting to Urshul form and continuing on. After a moment, the rest of the Pack pursues them.</li>
<li>Along the way, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> picks up the scent of human and Uratha blood, and comes across bullet marks in nearby brickwork. They find the beheaded corpse of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>, riddled with silver bullets.
<ul>
<li>They begin frantically texting other members of their Pack to check in, who respond that they're alright and sensed the same thing that <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> did. They tell their Pack that <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> is dead, and are immediately inundated with questions about what happened. They send their location, asking them to come quickly.</li>
<li>The other members of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> arrive imminently, and seem thirsty for blood even as they review the scene.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a>, an <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Elodoth">Elodoth</a> and second-in-command, questions <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> about their whereabouts at the time of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>'s death. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> confesses to being with the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a>, with the intent of spying on them at the request of a friend. Bridget basically accuses them of consorting with the enemy. <a href="../Setting/Samuel Hanselman.html">Samuel Hanselman</a> attempts to pacify her, but to no avail: she turns <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> out of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>, and in a daze, they walk away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> both expend a Willpower (putting Dade at 5) and they and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> attempt to remain hidden from the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. They succeed, as the other Uratha are too engrossed in the scene to notice them, and flee unnoticed.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> senses that the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> is performing the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a>, presumably to hunt down the killer of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>, but does not follow, resulting in a Breaking Point.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gets 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gets 1 Beat for checking in with Wren, 1 Beat for getting more information on <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>, and 1 Beat for #stars-and-wishes, putting him at 45 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Star: Whether or not it was intentional or planned, it certainly made for quite the conversation to see the secrets that <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> had been keeping all come out at once. There was a confessional mood about, it seems!</li>
<li>Star: <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> has certainly been on an interesting emotional rollercoaster lately, and the death of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> certainly seems to have escalated its progression. I wonder if they'll be among the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a> more frequently moving forward?</li>
<li>Wish: While Bridget did make some valid points regarding <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>, she did seem especially aggressive in her accusations. Makes me think she might be hiding something. Being second-in-command of the Pack certainly gave her something to gain from LeShaun's death...</li>
<li>Wish: I'm very curious about what will happen with <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a>. Will his Wolf-blooded nature present itself at an inopportune time? Will something befall him before <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> can help him? Will <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> be receptive to the Pack's desire to do so?</li>
</ul>
</li>
