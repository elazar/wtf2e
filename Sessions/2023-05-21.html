<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> discovers some benefits of her new employment. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> confers with <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> on several matters concerning the Pack and digs into <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>'s past.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> endows <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> with immunity from rage, which will last for a month if she loses contact with him. She converses with her new colleagues and learns about secret passages that they use within the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a> (to which this adds +2 to dice pools for related navigation rolls).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> travels to the library in the Hisil to confer with <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a>.
<ul>
<li>When asked about the black wolf spirit, <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> points out that all Uratha are spirit in part, and without more specifics, it could've been present for any reason, including some unrelated to the pack.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> seems afraid at the mention of a wound in the Hisil, and offers information on how to fix it, with no boon necessary, in exchange for a promise to heal the wound; <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> agrees. <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> advises him to perform the Hunting Grounds ritual to claim the territory for the pack in both spirit and flesh, as a prerequisite for an ancient ritual to heal the wound.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> asks <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> about <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>. The latter mentions Diana, a mortal of questionable sanity (and likely under the effects of lunacy) who visited the library some years ago to research Uratha.</li>
<li>When asked about sources of spontaneous rage in Uratha, <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> replies that it will require research and the price of &quot;finding knowledge freshest to arrive of yours, and destroy it utterly and completely.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> manages to unlock a door within the club and finds a room that contains a number of crafted items, some of them seemingly fetishes made by Uratha. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> perceives echoes from these artifacts, seemingly tied to a single individual (presumably <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>), that cause her to lose her sense of how long she's been in the room.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> and asks to meet; he agrees to do so that night.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> hacks into the library's system to access patron records. He finds a record of a Diana Cathwulf from several years ago and pulls up a list of the materials she checked out. He then expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 5) to take camera phone photos of about half of the list, but is caught in the act by a guard.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> uses the Strings of the Heart (p. 108) merit to discover that he wants to forget some awfulness that happened five years ago when he left a girlfriend. He offers him the means to forget, but shaken, the guard tells him to leave and threatens him if he loses his job because of this incident.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gets 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gains 1 Beat for taking steps toward each of the aspirations of discovering the source of Sister Cathwulf's power and investigating the source of the wound in the Hisil and another Beat for stars and wishes, putting him at 73 Beats (14 XP 3 Beats).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes :
<ul>
<li>Star: The fetish room visited by <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> was definitely interesting. Descriptions of it and its contents made me curious about what else might be in there.</li>
<li>Star: <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> proved a very valuable informational resource for <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>. It was nice to see him be able to lean on someone than <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> or <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> for help.</li>
<li>Wish: The relationship between <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> and his parents has been developing very gradually up to this point. I'd like to see a more substantial progression in it.</li>
<li>Wish: I wouldn't mind seeing another scene with <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and/or <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> prior to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s return. Interactions between the former and other characters have been consistently interesting.</li>
</ul>
