<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The Pack pursues a Totem spirit toward Belle Island. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> meets a young Uratha named <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Pack's headquarters has a broken dinner plate, from a house where domestic abuse took place, for a locus.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> performs a rite to give them the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> condition to allow them to touch ephemeral prey (in this case the Totem spirit being pursued, <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>) with natural weapons.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> shift into the Shadow and each spend a point of Essence (putting Dade at 6) to shift into Urshul form for ideal speed and perception to pursue the Totem. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> remains in the material world to pursue the Totem at its last known location there.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> finds a young boy of about 10 with a wolf spirit guarding him. The boy introduces himself as <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> and can speak First Tongue. Paca discovers that he's Uratha and that this is likely in his territory. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> seems to know that the Totem spirit has left the area and headed downtown.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> have a brief encounter with the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>, who allow them to go after they indicate they are on a hunt and just passing through. The two pass a run-down shop that elicits a bad feeling, one urging them to surrender. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> recognizes it to be a corrupt Essence-draining place in the Shadow, the Shole, that can lure human and spirit alike, and notes its location for future reference. <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> encounters an entity claiming to be his future self, <a href="../Setting/Future Elric.html">Future Elric</a>, who accompanies the pair.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends another Essence to use <a href="../System/Pack Awareness.html">Pack Awareness</a> to communicate with <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and ask that she get a boat and use it to get to Belle Island where <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> suspect the spirit has gone. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> arrives at the docks, manages to render a dock worker unconscious, steals her keys, and steals a boat, leaving the other two on the shore to cross the river.</li>
</ul>
