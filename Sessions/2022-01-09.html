<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Background music is <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=wl-GY1eRV28">HOUR CITY AT NIGHT JAZZ NOIR DARK JAZZ AMBIENCE MUSIC VIDEO</a>.</li>
<li>Per Thunder, everyone can recover Willpower and top off Essence (to 10).</li>
<li>It's currently a half moon. Everyone who has this as their Auspice regains a Rage point.</li>
<li>It's been a few weeks since we've heard anything from or about <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>, <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, or really anybody.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> meets with <a href="../Setting/John%20Selby.html">John Selby</a> and brings a Five Guys meal to appease him. He requests some glass bottles, a small flashlight, and a tooth from a predatory animal. Dade manages to find a raccoon in the woods and and extract one of its teeth.</li>
<li>Selby relates that there's a Magath car spirit in the vicinity trying to run people over (sounds unlikely to be <a href="../Setting/Walker%20Breaker.html">Walker Breaker</a>) as well as another Magath wolf fire spirit scoping out the Pack's territory. Dade relates recent events with <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>.</li>
<li>Selby recommends a constant patrol of the Pack's territory within the Shadow and offers to teach Dade two Rites that may help: <a href="../System/Shadowbind.html">Shadowbind</a> or <a href="../System/Expel.html">Expel</a>. Dade opts to to learn Shadowbind. As an <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Ithaeur">Ithaeur</a>, he is able to learn it by spending 1 XP for it (half the 3 XP cost rounded down, or 5 Beats), leaving him at 17 Beats. He takes a night to prepare to conduct the Rite.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> visits <a href="../Setting/Wise%20Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> at the library. She asks if it's possible for her to become solely human and to shed her Uratha forms. In exchange for its help with that, Learned Stray asks that she drive a vigarous increase of traffic into the library (&quot;for as long as it takes&quot;) and an influx of stray animals or people with a sense of being lost and unsure where to go.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wise%20Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> suggests that <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> seek out solitude to find the <a href="../Setting/White%20Agora.html">White Agora</a>. Beyond her, Clara's only options are traveling deep within the Shadow to find <em>Kamduis-Ur</em>, the Death Wolf followed by the <a href="../System/Tribe.html#Bone+Shadows">Bone Shadows</a>, or Mother Luna herself.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> go out on a date. Wren talks about their Irish ancestry and wanting to find a nursing job of some sort. Miguel talks about also being without a job and he and his mother being without a car, and not being able to see his mother due to her busy schedule.</li>
<li>Wren scours local dealerships, finds a car, and presents it to Miguel as a gift. Miguel is speechless, breaks down into tears in gratitude, embraces Wren, and thanks her. Miguel offers to take the two for ice cream to celebrate.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> goes to a bad part of town near the Pack's territory, watching for anyone with a phone or laptop. She intends to use her <a href="../System/Iron%20Slave.html">Iron Slave</a> gift to extract criminal contact information from such a device in attempt to find someone who will sell her a gun.</li>
<li>A young woman with dark hair and a knife attempts to mug <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>. After trying to defend herself with her purse as an improvised weapon and failing, she shifts reflexively and engages in a brawl with the woman, who suffers lunacy as a result.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> manages to get the woman to surrender her knife and phone, then tells her to relate to others that this is her part of town, before leaving her to faint on the ground. She is able to extract the information she needs from the woman's phone.</li>
<li>Returning home, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> finds the car that <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> gifted <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and the house empty. Thinking this may be the result of her foray into the criminal world or <a href="../Setting/Walker%20Breaker.html">Walker Breaker</a> somehow returning, she cursorily checks the car trunk for a hostage and finds nothing, then returns to the house and attempts to ask nearby spirits why the car is there, but is unable to do so.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> calls <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> with her cell phone and he tells her that he got the car from his girlfriend, who Paca promptly begins praising in avid Spanish. Believing this girlfriend is <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, Paca sends Clara a text message:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you. ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Pack meets at HQ to trade information. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> relays what he learned from <a href="../Setting/John%20Selby.html">John Selby</a>. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> mentions going to the library, but doesn't go into detail. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> remarks on recent crime increase in their territory and mentions having come into informational resources to help them stop it. She also gushes about <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s girlfriend getting them the new car, casting her glance between Clara and <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>. Eventually, it comes out that Wren, not Clara, is dating Miguel. Paca tells her shortly &quot;take care of my son or I'll break you.&quot; The two exchange numbers, which seems like a good idea under the circumstances, and Paca leaves.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> returns home to find <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> petting and conversing with <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a>. Little Shadow asks Dade for a favor: to help him see his parents, even if he can't interact with them. Dade promises to look into the possibility, knowing that it could complicate matters if his parents see him. Little Shadows seems satisfied and the two go to get steak before Dade takes him to spend time with <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> at <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s place.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for recap, 1 Bear for attendance, 3 Beats &quot;just for being back,&quot; and 2 Beats for &quot;great roleplaying from everyone.&quot;</li>
<li>Dade gains 1 Beat from speaking with Selby to find out how to deal with Hanzer-gah Nina.</li>
<li>Dade gains 1 Beat from his long-term aspiration to find out more about his father and his fate being considered fulfilled, putting him at 26 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Need to come up with character goals: big and small, individual and group, etc.
<ul>
<li>
<del>It's been a few sessions since I've done anything toward this aspiration: &quot;Find out more about my father and his fate.&quot; Is there much more for <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> to learn? If so, it may be worth having him pay <a href="../Setting/Wise%20Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> a visit? Or is there a better way for him to go about it?</del>
<ul>
<li>We'll consider the aspiration fulfilled. I need to pick a new one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<del>Are <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> considered part of the Pack for mechanical purposes? If so, it seems to conflict with <a href="2021-12-05.html#%5E9a5f22">this occurrence</a>.</del>
<ul>
<li>They have not officially joined yet, so no.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why were <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> both <a href="2021-10-24.html#%5E94f914">searching for the Pack</a> at the same time, even though they didn't know each other? Seems like quite a coincidence. Wren's purpose seemingly has something to do with their connection to the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. Clara's purpose doesn't seem clear. The intentions of either in collaborating with the rest of the Pack were never really questioned when they first showed up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We should consider setting up a Google Doc per session where anyone in the group can take notes, ask questions, etc.</li>
<li>Ask Thunder before next session:
<ol>
<li>
<del>if she'd be okay with the characters exchanging text messages between sessions using Discord (maybe in the #news-and-rumors channel, which hasn't been active for a while).</del> She is, and created #in-game-texts for this purpose.</li>
<li>if she's prepared music. Some suggestions from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/matthewturland/posts/10105755872048550:6">a Facebook thread</a>:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://w2g.tv/?lang=en">Watch2Gether</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/group-session/">Spotify group session</a> shared via a link sent to Discord (requires a Premium subscription)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>about making a point of taking a regular bio break about mid-session, maybe by setting a timer to remind us.</li>
<li>if there are any particular sources for good descriptions of performances of Rites.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Things that could be useful against <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> - see p. 91:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The totem helps with the hunt while in the Shadow. In return, the pack always has the Resonant Condition (see p. 188) for their totem spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Auspice Benefit <em>Spirit Howl</em> (top right of p. 29)</li>
<li>Hunter's Aspect (bottom left of p. 29) - gives prey the Mystified Condition (top right of p. 309)</li>
<li>
<a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> Condition - <a href="../System/Tribe.html#Hunters+in+Darkness">Hunters in Darkness</a> (e.g. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>) can sense the Gauntlet's current strength, which may be useful in combination with Hunter's Aspect, which imposes that strength as a penalty on spirits affected by the Mystified Condition.</li>
<li>My new <a href="../System/Shadowbind.html">Shadowbind</a> Rite.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> technically counts as a full pack member and can participate in the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a>.</li>
<li>The Shadow Hunter ability (p. 116) of my <a href="../System/Crescent%20Moon's%20Gift.html">Crescent Moon's Gift</a>.</li>
<li>My <a href="../System/Hunt%20of%20Fire%20and%20Ice.html">Hunt of Fire and Ice</a> Gift. Would need to carry a source of cold/ice during the hunt, maybe a tank of liquid nitrogen if I can secure one? (Maybe from an acquaintance in departments of Science or Agriculture at the university.)</li>
