<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> arranges a play date between Socks and <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> gather <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> from <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s apartment. The pack reunites at <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s apartment. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> arranges for <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> to visit his parents in a few days.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> awakens in HQ from her trip to <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>, then goes outside to find <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> and offers to introduce him to her cat Socks. The two depart for <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s place. When they arrive, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> leaves <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> outside and goes inside to find Socks. <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> then enters and the two cautiously gauge each other. Socks then begins showing <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> their favorite hiding places.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> leave the graveyard. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> to assess the situation with the police being at <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s place, then he and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> go there. When they arrive, they see new spirits draped in black cloaks and fog that are difficult to identify and drawn to <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s emotions.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> expends 1 Essence (putting him at 6) to use Shadow Gaze (p. 115) on a grief spirit, which just finished devouring a night spirit, and learns that its bane is the song &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; He approaches the spirit and asks why it's there. It answers that someone grieves, a mortal touched by Luna grieving a lost love. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> convinces the spirit to leave, then uses another 1 Essence (putting him at 5) to use Spirit Howl (p. 29) to scatter the remaining spirits.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> uses a key (we assume given to him by <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>) to let himself and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> in. Remaining spirits within the apartment have hidden themselves following the Spirit Howl. He finds <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> upstairs, seemingly having started to pack things but given up halfway through to avoid a panic attack. He tries unsuccessfully to calm <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> down, then ushers <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> into the room to help, but he is also unsuccessful. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> seems an owl spirit in the corner, who points out a song on a nearby CD. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> pops the disc into a CD player and plays the track, which seems to help calm <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> indicates that he would rather stay with <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> than at his house, and would like to see <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts her to that effect; she responds with a thumbs up. They depart from the house safely. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> notices a silhouette of a black wolf sitting on the sidewalk that vanishes as quickly as it appeared. He texts <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> later, but he's unable to provide any further information on the spirit. During the car ride home, <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> learns that <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> now  knows English, and the two get into an animated conversation.</li>
<li>Once <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> figure out sleeping arrangements, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> speaks to <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> and asks if he'd like to call his parents, then dials for him. It's apparently late enough that they were asleep, but his father comes to, shakes his mother awake, and they proceed to have a very tear-filled reunion over the phone. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> struggles with how to answer their questions about his life because of the Veil. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> also brings up arranging a visit between them, and they confirm a date and time to meet two days later. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> fulfills his short-term aspiration of arranging for <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> to visit his parents.</li>
<li>Back at <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s place, Socks and <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> are getting on well. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> gathers them into her car and drives them to <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s apartment, where he lets them in. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> talk and she does her best to reassure him that everything will be okay.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> have a conversation in First Tongue. He explains the situation with the wound in the Hisii to her. She tells him about her new employment at the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>.</li>

<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes :
<ul>
<li>Star: The play date between Sock and Germaine was adorable. Would love to see more interactions among the pack's pets.</li>
<li>Star: The scene with Clara reassuring Miguel was heartwarming. I always enjoy seeing those two interact.</li>
<li>Wish: The black wolf spirit definitely piqued my interest. Would be interested in finding out more about it.</li>
<li>Wish: The wound in the Hisil has proven perplexing thus far. Hoping to see some progress on that front.</li>
