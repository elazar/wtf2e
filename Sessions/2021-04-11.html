<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The Pack captures their Totem, <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>, and claims victory. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> joins the Pack. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> meet <a href="../Setting/Julian Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> senses that <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> is between the material world and the <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, in an intermediary state without a corporeal body. <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> has made it to the bank of Belle Island and is weaving between people to elude the Pack.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> find an odd spirit wearing a combination of pirate and businessman's clothing with a crowd of spirits around him nearby. Dade bargains with for him 1 Essence from each of them (putting <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> at 5) to have a companion of his row them to Belle Island.</li>
<li>When they reach Belle Island, they encounter a glade, a place of perfect peace, which are difficult to find in the Shadow. They spot <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> and <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> is able to reach out and find <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends another Essence (putting him at 4) to use <a href="../System/Pack Awareness.html">Pack Awareness</a> to communicate with Paca and inform her of the spirit's location.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> shift into Hishu form. The Pack each spend one Willpower (putting <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> at 5) to steathily head off <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>. She manages to elude them and expends an Essence to double her speed, then sprints back across the water. The Pack regroups back at the boat <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> took and crosses the water in pursuit. The Pack pursues <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> all the way to Highland Park and into their headquarters before declaring victory in the Hunt.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> agrees to bind to the Pack as their Totem provided they do not summon her on any night of the full moon; she can now appear within their vicinity whenever need be. She also bequeaths to each a gift that they'll have so long as she's bound to them: 1 dot in Stamina and 1 dot in Stealth. The Pack's locus recharges, dispensing 3 Essence to each of them (putting <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> back at 7).</li>
<li>The Pack loses the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> condition and spends a brief respite in camaraderie, drinking to their victory. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> fulfills his short-term Aspiration of obtaining a Totem.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Future Elric.html">Future Elric</a> offers that his goal is to look out for <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a>; <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> can't discern anything beyond that he is truthful in that respect. He seems intent on joining the Pack for no other reason that he will give, and the Pack bids him leave for now.</li>
<li>The Pack then resolves to get food and return to the area where <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> found <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. They buy a chicken nugget meal for him, then go to find him. Once they meet, the Pack are able to sense that he far outranks them, and they present their offering to him, which he devours voraciously, thanks them, and then becomes partly ephemeral.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> introduces the Pack to his wolf guardian <a href="../Setting/Muthgah Ninna.html">Muthgah Ninna</a>, which translates to &quot;Predator with the Bloody Jowls&quot; in First Tongue. He then warns them against going down a manhole, saying that he can't go down there again and that they shouldn't either. He calls after someone called &quot;Bright Eyes,&quot; also referring to him as Michael, and reveals his surname to be Stantz. He also reveals himself to be a part of the Crescent Shadows, his former pack, who entered the manhole and, save for him, never escaped. Michael was the alpha of his pack.</li>
<li>He also reveals marks of Renown, the highest of which is Cunning followed by Wisdom, Purity, and Honor. He bears the mark of an Ithaeur, but has conducted himself like an Irraka, acting as a scout and going head to head with an enemy larger than him. The Pack Totem, <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>, offers a greeting indicating that <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> outranks even her. The Pack convinces <a href="../Setting/Muthgah Ninna.html">Muthgah Ninna</a> to let them help him, and he asks to join the Pack; the Pack agrees.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> seems to habitually shift from Hishu to Daru, as if it's relaxing not to stay in one form for too long. He also seems to glance into the Shadow every few minutes. After being fed twice, he's dropped to 1 Harmony. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> agrees to take Little Shadow to his Safe Place, and the Pack parts ways for the night.</li>
<li>At some point after going to sleep, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> regains consciousness in an old house, being watched by spirits in twilight, and realizes that he's dreaming. He can't detect any scents, despite his senses functioning normally, and senses that this dream isn't for him, that someone else should be having it. Looking out a window, Dade seems an image of Luna, in a crescent shape, with a drop of blood between its ends. He awakens to the dawn, howling. He regains 1 Willpower for sleeping, putting him at 6.</li>
<li>The next day, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s son <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> questions her about being out the night before, asking if she's seeing anyone. Miguel apparently has an interest in someone named <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>, who seemingly has some connection to London. A friend contacts <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a>, offering to introduce him to someone named Alex.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> awakens, searching for some processed meat to feed <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> for breakfast; <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> goes up to 2 Harmony. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> asks after <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> tells him about his dream, and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> suspects that Luna is trying to get <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s attention, and likely not in a good way. He also tells <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> that the Crescent Shadows held the Highland Park territory before <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s pack. The two go on a walk, and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spots a man in casual clothing across their territory border. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> shows his teeth to the man, who apparently recognizes him, and questions why he is with a Forsaken. He introduces himself as <a href="../Setting/Julian Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> of the Fire-Touched.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> takes a new Aspiration: discovering more about <a href="../Setting/Julian Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> and his interest in <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 1 Beat for completing the Hunt.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> receives 1 Beat for fulfilling his short-term Aspiration of obtaining a Totem.</li>

<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> receives 1 Beat for personal difficulties, leaving him with 8 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Would be funny if some of the pick-pocketing crimes happened because of Nick Shaw, even though he's in London. Though, Miguel did ask <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> to go there...</li>
<li>Ask Thunder if she's heard of Iliza Shlesinger. https://www.iliza.com/bio</li>
