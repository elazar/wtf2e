<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> sees an unconscious <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> off to a hospital. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> infiltrate a worship service for <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> and task one of their followers with gathering intelligence on <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> awakens after having been possessed by Broken Mirror and visits with them after they reinhabit <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> waits with an unconscious <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> for an ambulance to arrive. He props his head up in attempt to keep him stable (1 success on Wits + Medicine), then pads him down to see if he's carrying anything (1 success Wits + Investigation).
<ul>
<li>His wallet indicates a Resources rating of 1 (paycheck to paycheck), a haircomb, a few mementos from various admirers back in his heyday (cards, coins, gift cards to bars and restaurants, a gift card for a nice game console), an overly flattering photo of himself, and a bit of crack cocaine.</li>
<li>Dade tosses the cocaine as far from them as he can. The paramedics arrive shortly after, load him up, and take information from Dade. They tell him that they're taking him to Highland Park General Hospital, which should be in the pack's territory.</li>
<li>We determined that <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> probably would've gone with the rest of the Pack when they left the scene.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the paramedics leave, Dade heads to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s place. There, he finds <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s buddy spirit bearing her farewell before it vanishes, and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> asleep on the couch. He also notices a patchwork owl dream spirit feeding off of Miguel's dream essence.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> discuss their plan to investigate and/or infiltrate the local church of <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>. It's currently a crescent moon (Dade's moon). Dade is able to use <a href="../System/Pack Awareness.html">Pack Awareness</a> to sense <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> and finds that she's at HQ, still healing from her wounds (the most likely cause of her radio silence).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> regains 1 Willpower (putting him at 4) and 2 of the 9 Essence (putting him at 10) from the HQ locus. He and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> cross into the Shadow at the fire hydrant locus, shift (at no cost due to being at Harmony 6) into Urshul form, and travel six miles to the church. The area is filled with faith spirits in the form of wolves in Garou form, either black or white, wearing halos.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 1 Essence (putting him at 9) to flare his Wisdom Renown marks to a group of nearby spirits, giving him the <a href="../System/Wise.html">Wise</a> condition. He questions the spirits, but other than identifying <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> and her altercation at the Smokey Bottle Bar, they provide little useful information. They offer him information about her associates, but state that he must &quot;witness their faith, or even experience it&quot; (referring to the congregation).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> awakens in Hishu form in their own bed to see the body of <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> rise. Broken Mirror apparently helped to facilitate Wren fleeing the fight with the Pure (which Wren notes could cause issues in the future, though resolves to cross that bridge when they come to it), then reinhabited Rebecca's body afterward.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> checks their phone and finds a text from <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, noting that he hasn't seen them in a while and asking if everything is alright. Wren responds briefly, unsure of how to explain recent happenings over text. He includes a tarot card reading (Past: Nine of Coins, Upright; Present: Page of Swords, Reversed; Future: Ten of Wands, Upright) in the text. (Dade won't receive this until the following day.) <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> seems unhappy that they're texting Dade, and makes them promise not to go to the aid of the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a>. Rebecca seems to appeal to their loneliness without her presence.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> asks <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> about <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> in the context of being their beau. Wren has apparently told Rebecca about <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, and informs her of Paca's relation to <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>, the fact that Paca shifted in front of Miguel, and the mild Lunacy that followed. Wren admits to not having checked on Miguel since the incident. Rebecca forwardly admits to finding Wren attractive, admiring them, even loving them. (Spirits have no concept of gender, despite the limits of Wren's attractions.) Wren states they also admire Rebecca, in particular how free she seems. Rebecca offers to &quot;make them happy,&quot; but Wren says that they're enjoying just sitting together and talking with her.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> return to the fire hydrant, cross back into the Flesh, shift into wolf form, travel to the area near the church, and scour the area for <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>.
<ul>
<li>They find a group of 12 congregants donning robes depicting the spirits they saw earlier, colored in every shade from pure white to pure black with red ribbons of various numbers attached to robes, particularly to those in white robes. They refer to each other using peculiar-sounding moon / wolf / hunter-related names (e.g. &quot;Lobo,&quot; &quot;Hunter,&quot; &quot;Artemis,&quot; &quot;Lupa&quot;). Those clothed in white (2 successes on Wits + Socialize) and with red ribbons appear afforded more respect, likely due to rank, while those in black appear to be novices.</li>
<li>They locate <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>, humming what sounds like a pop or rock song to herself. She stops briefly, seems to look toward them, but then smiles and continues on her way toward the church. Dade and Clara are in Hishu form and maintain 30 and 20 yards' distance from her respectively. Sister Cathwulf stops to rest her feet, and Dade crosses the street in attempt to get a better look at her. She watches him, smiles, says &quot;good hunting, my lord&quot; out loud, gets up, and continues on toward the church.</li>
<li>They tail her to the church, which she enters, and the door shuts behind her. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> shifts into Dalu form and gives <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> a boost to attempt to get him onto the roof (Dexterity + Athletics + 1 for Clara's help). Clara hears the congregation sing a Nightwish song about the apocalypse, from which Dade recalls the chorus as recited by <a href="../Setting/David Stanze.html">David Stanze</a> shortly before Dade killed him. No one sees Dade during his time on the roof.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> hear <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> recite a prayer to Mother Luna, various demi-gods, and a prophetess named Diana. She gives a sermon explaining what Uratha are and calling them gods, then transitions to a story about Diana, who first witnessed Uratha as they engaged in combat and interpreted it as a religious experience. As she continues, Dade and Clara are able to identify her ramblings as a poor patchwork of internet searches, pop culture references, and a constructed almagamation of various legends and myths tied to some ancient religions, much of it inaccurate and rather pathetically sad.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spots a novice (who we subsequently named <a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a>) who exits the church briefly, relieves himself nearby, then begins to walk back toward the building. Dade spends 1 Essence (putting him at 8) to use <a href="../System/Pack Awareness.html">Pack Awareness</a> to telepathically communicate with <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and points the novice out to her as someone they might question. She proceeds to flirt with him to attempt to lure him into an alleyway, gaining the Leveraged condition (p. 308). Dade attempts to shimmy down a tree to reach them, but falls and crashes to the ground (1 Beat for dramatic failure), loudly enough to interrupt the service.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> shifts into Urhan form and quickly runs toward <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and the novice, just in time to go unnoticed by one of the clergy coming outside to check on the disturbance. Dade makes it to the alley, shifts back into Hishu form, and pins the novice to the wall.</li>
<li>When the novice refuses to cooperate, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> shifts briefly into Dalu form in attempt to coerce him. The novice, who later gives his name as Silas, becomes enraptured, calling Dade &quot;my lord.&quot; Dade swears him to silence, then questions him about <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>. He indicates that the red ribbons represent Uratha sightings. He names a series of apartments downtown as where he believes Sister Cathwulf resides. He joined the cult approximately one year ago out of curiosity, then was invited to witness Uratha and &quot;prove himself.&quot; Dade charges him with gathering information on Sister Cathwulf, her identity, her background, her whereabouts, etc. and says he will return during next week's service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gets 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>Dade gets 1 Beat for fulfilling the aspiration of investigating <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> worship activities and 1 Beat for the dramatic failure, putting him at 20.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Star: Seeing more of the relationship between Wren and Rebecca / Broken Mirror has been great. It's definitely made me more curious about how they met and how Rebecca came to be possessed.</li>
<li>Star: We were finally able to learn more about <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>! What we've discovered about the nature of their religion makes me wonder more about the source of <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>'s power.</li>
<li>Wish: <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> has been a relatively silent participant the last few sessions, and I still have the aspiration to get him speaking English again...</li>
<li>Wish: Definitely want to learn more about the origin of <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>'s popularity and its seeming disappearance. There's something Faustian there...</li>
</ul>
