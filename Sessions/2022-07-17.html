<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>In a flashback that happens prior to <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> undertaking the mission to the <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> church, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> brings <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> home; he says little on the ride. Once they return home, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> watches over Miguel while he sleeps. Paca goes for a brief run, somewhat in denial of what's happened. She stops to get food from Burger King, in something of an observance of the Pack's post-hunt tradition.</li>
<li>While there, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> notices a gym trainer named Roger dining on a salad (smothered in Ranch dressing) there, with whom she sits and converses with briefly. She asks him out for drinks at the Smokey Bottle Bar on Friday at 7; he accepts, and she heads back home.</li>
<li>Upon arriving, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> gives food to <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> (for when he wakes up) before eating herself. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> arrives not long after. After receiving thanks for Paca from caring for Miguel, Clara leaves with Dade. Out of lunging range, an owl spirit appears to be giving Miguel pleasant dreams, which Paca finds somewhat unsettling after the encounter with <a href="../Setting/Su Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> gets the feeling of someone watching her, albeit not in a malicious way, though she catches a scent of disease. A voice speaks in First Tongue, asking her what she'll do about <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> having seen the things he's seen, and offers to &quot;help that battered mind of his,&quot; saying that Paca was destined to &quot;open his eyes.&quot;
<ul>
<li>When Paca asks the voice of its identify, the voice only responds that it's &quot;one of the siblings your stories would not tell you of,&quot; and claims to &quot;only bring faith and truth.&quot;</li>
<li>Paca sees a figure of sorts step forward, almost like a trick of the light, humanoid in shape and wearing red and orange robes. The figure clarifies that it will make Miguel known not only as the child of a Uratha, but revered as the son of a goddess for generations. The one figure becomes two, one pure white and the other pure black, both appearing as Uratha in war form, wearing spiked halos, and speaking in perfect unison with each other.</li>
<li>Paca refuses their offer and to engage them further. The two spirits express their regret of her refusal, then melt into the Shadow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> wakes a few moments later, relaxed from his pleasant dreams. He asks <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> if he's seeing her, and if what he's experiencing reality. After a moment, he cautiously approaches herself and touches her to confirm that she's real, and he allows her to hug him. She's able to see from his experiences in the Shadow that something has changed in Miguel, &quot;cracked on the inside.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> asks <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> point blank if she's a werewolf. Paca squeezes him, then steps back and responds that she is, and confirms that <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> is, but doesn't mention that <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> or <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> also are. He then asks about his own nature, mentioning that Clara had told him that she and Paca were both werewolves, but that Miguel didn't appear to be one. Paca admits that she isn't sure what will happen to him, but promises to remain supportive of him regardless. She also tells him that he must keep their nature a secret. After placating him by answering a few questions, she retires to bed. When Dade and Clara return from the mission to the <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> church, Dade takes Little Shadow back home with him.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> reaches out to <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> to ask about the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>. Whistler confirms that the owner is powerful and capable when it comes to matters of Uratha (and not a concern where the Veil is concerned), but isn't certain whether he can enable a Uratha to revert to human form permanently. Whistler hesitates to answer further over the phone, and invites Dade to speak more on the matter at his office.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> goes to <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>'s office, and notices fresh scars on Whistler's hands from his alteraction with <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>, but Whistler doesn't go into detail about it. Whistler says the owner goes by the name Horris Albequerque Fenechurch III, is very wealthy and eccentric, and has the ability to permanently remove Uratha rage. Whistler describes the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a> as decadent and tells Dade that he needs only go there and tell the club's security that he wishes to speak with the owner, do everything possible to keep his attention once he has it, and not be surprised by anything he sees in the club. With that information, Dade takes his leave.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> have <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> over for a steak dinner. Clara mentions having &quot;gone to church with a friend&quot; the previous night. Miguel asks more questions about werewolves, some of which Clara answers; an awkward conversation about the nature of Uratha ensues, which Miguel enthusiastically absorbs. Clark asks Miguel how he is; he seems better, knowing now that he has Paca and Clara watching over him.</li>
<li>While <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> does the dishes, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> excuse themselves to discuss the church mission. Clara informs Paca that they now have a mole inside the church. Paca thanks her for looking after Miguel; Clara thanks Paca for the dinner. Paca says that she'll see Clara the next time that the Pack meets and goes back inside.</li>
<li>After desert, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> departs. She notices an emaciated wolf spirit sitting on a street corner looking at her, approaches it, and asks if it's okay. It merely says that it is as it should be, and introduces itself as Dust-to-Dust. Clara recognizes it as a death spirit, also called <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/The_Harvesters">harvesters</a>. Dust-to-Dust claims to have been sent by Death Wolf, saying that she has heard of Clara's desire and that it would require &quot;quite the death,&quot; referring to her spiritual half, rage, and all that makes up her Uratha existence, in an act of great pain. Dust-to-Dust was sent to test Clara's resolve, and says she has her patron's blessing to seek her out in the Shadow before fading out of existence.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> dresses up in his best attire and goes to the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>. After emphasizing that he's &quot;new,&quot; the security guard with the guest list allows him entry and one of the bouncers (apparently named Henry) guides him inside to a room with a table laden with lavish foods, drink, and drugs, and a very opulent, bald, bespectacled man in lavish clothing at the opposite end of the table sitting in a throne-like chair.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> notices a brief flash of orange slit-like reptilian eyes on the man that makes his humanity questionable.</li>
<li>The man, <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>, thanks the bouncer, who then departs. At the man's insistence, Dade takes a drink from the table, which renders him a bit tipsy. Dade notices that his eyes appear orange and slits rather than ovular. The man offers two options: 1) temporary relief from rage involving killing a human; 2) employment by him for security, with the longevity of the relief from rage being dependent on proximity to him.</li>
<li>The man seems familiar with <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, but does not deal with them. He offers more wine and a &quot;to-go box,&quot; both of which Dade declines. He clarifies that the process of suppressing rage is painless, and encourages Dade to have his associate (Clara, who he does not name) seek him out. He buzzes Henry back in, who escorts him out, and he takes a rideshare home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, asking that she visit him at his apartment to discuss something. She visits him, and he details his visit to the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a> and the options presented to him. He asks after subsequent happenings at Paca's briefly before Clara takes her leave.</li>
<li>After <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> goes to sleep, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> speaks to the owl dream spirit. She asks it to watch for the Collector, who the owl seems to recognize as <a href="../Setting/Su Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>. In return, she offers 3 Essence and continued occupation of her home if the owl spirit finds <a href="../Setting/Su Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>.
<ul>
<li>The owl spirit seems to like <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>, dote on him even, and hold him as its own. Rather than Essence, which it already gets from Miguel, the owl asks that <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> help to see to it that Miguel sleeps especially deeply.</li>
<li>The owl spirit offers to give <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> good dreams as well, in exchange for Essence, which she seems amenable to. The spirit takes this literally and puts Paca to sleep for five days (which will cause her to miss her Friday date).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gets 1 for session recap, 1 for attendance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gains 1 beat for his short-term aspiration of gaining admittance to the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>, putting him at 23.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Being inside the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a> and learning more about its benefactor was definitely interesting! I'm not sure we'll end up pursuing it as a plot point, but I'm glad I explored it.</li>
<li>I've enjoyed seeing <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s journey progress. Her meeting with Dust-to-Dust was intriguing. It was also nice to see she and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> share a moment, even if he wasn't able to help her much.</li>
<li>Still not much in the way of appearances from <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s enthusiasm toward learning more about Uratha has been entertaining, if not interesting in and of itself. It'll be interesting to see where his curiosity leads...</li>
