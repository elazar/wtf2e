<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> receives a mission from <a href="../Setting/LeShaun%20White.html">LeShaun White</a> and has a date with <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> shows his parents' home to <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> travels to the Shadow and visits with the <a href="../Setting/White%20Agora.html">White Agora</a>, then meets Wren and Miguel for pizza. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> meets with the leader of a local Hunter cell. The Pack discusses conducting a Sacred Hunt for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Background music is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIqEDU-op88">Kai Engel - Snowfall (Intro) - Official Music</a>.</li>
<li>It's Monday and currently a crescent moon.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> receives a text from <a href="../Setting/LeShaun%20White.html">LeShaun White</a>: &quot;Meet me in 15 minutes, or less if possible, at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Come alone.&quot;
<ul>
<li>The DIA is in known <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> territory.</li>
<li>LeShaun asks Wren, &quot;Why are we lacking our <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Cahalith">Cahalith</a>?&quot; Wren explains that they're being &quot;pulled along with another pack's shennanigans&quot; and reports to LeShaun that the pack has &quot;had <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">a spirit</a> declare war on them.&quot;</li>
<li>LeShaun warns them not to become too involved, and reminds them of their loyalty to the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. He asks that they tell him next time they feel the urge to &quot;wander off.&quot;</li>
<li>Wren explains the &quot;slight complication&quot; of them dating <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and his relation to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>. Looking rather conflicted at whether to laugh or be concerned, LeShaun merely says that Wren is &quot;full of surprises,&quot; then instructs them to continue associating with the Pack and feeding intelligence to LeShaun.</li>
<li>LeShaun is aware of the incidents involving <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> at the Smokey Bottle Bar and the disappearance of the original <a href="../Setting/Crescent%20Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> shows <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> the home of his parents.
<ul>
<li>He provides their names, Hellen and Jesse, and the street address of the house.</li>
<li>It takes a lot of effort from Little Shadow to avoid shifting out of Homid form.
<ul>
<li>See Breaking Points that count toward Flesh for Harmony 3 or lower (p. 104) on how to help him retain Homid form so he can meet his parents safely.</li>
<li>Some particular examples: refusing to participate in the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, staying out of the <em>Hisil</em> for one week to one month, using a silvered weapon against another werewolf (e.g. <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In case Little Shadow's parents want to keep him, Dade should figure out how that can be done safely. <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> or <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> may be able to provide advice on this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> travels to an isolated island glade in the Shadow known to the Forsaken in order to seek out the <a href="../Setting/White%20Agora.html">White Agora</a>.
<ul>
<li>She shifts into Hishu form and enters the Spirit, where the glade appears as a void.</li>
<li>She meditates on her brother <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a>. It's implied that her First Change may have been responsible for him being in the hospital.</li>
<li>The White Agora doesn't reveal itself to Clara, but speaks to her in mystical written form. Clara communicates that she wants to find Death Wolf in order to reach Mother Luna. When asked why, she ultimately confesses that she wishes to know why she is or must be Uratha and if or how she can stop being so.</li>
<li>The White Agora appears briefly as a figure in white robes. It tells Clara that, to get what she wants, she must sever ties with her pack, all Uratha, and their entire world. Clara would have to remain with the White Agora for training, then be passed her off to another teacher.</li>
<li>Clara says she needs time to think. The White Agora bids her farewell, and Clara reappears in the Flesh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> reviews the contacts in the phone she stole from her would-be mugger, trying to sort out which of them might serve her purpose.
<ul>
<li>She finds that the woman has or had a connection to the <a href="../Setting/Rock%20City%20Compact.html">Rock City Compact</a> and a man's name: Rafeeq, the likely leader of the group.</li>
<li>There's a conversation about buying a truck with silvered headlights, flashlights, and stakes and making sure &quot;the crackheads don't find their way into the basement like last time.&quot;</li>
<li>Paca sends a message to Rafeeq: &quot;I heard you have some problems I may be able to help you solve. Meet me tonight. ~P&quot; She specifies the location of a warehouse. Rafeeq receives the message and doesn't reply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, who agrees to meet him at HQ later that night around 11 to join him on the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> meet for a date.
<ul>
<li>Wren expresses concern about <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and her feelings about their relationship. Miguel reassures them, saying he'll vouch for Wren with Paca if need be. Wren hopes it doesn't come to that. The two profess their love for each other.</li>
<li>Miguel also mentions his worries about Paca seemingly emotionally distant, the recent odd timings of her presence and absence, and the car going missing. Wren points out that Paca may not be forthcoming because she fears for Miguel's safety, which doesn't seem to convince Miguel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> to invite her on the hunt, with the implication that it entails joining the Pack. Clara responds, saying she'll think about it. Paca responds with a thumbs up.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> asking if they should meet for a tutoring session. In the end, Miguel invites Clara to join he and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> for pizza.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> meets with Rafeeq (which is apparently not his real name).
<ul>
<li>She returns the phone of his associate <a href="../Setting/Cheryll.html">Cheryll</a> to him; Paca apparently scared her pretty well, which Rafeeq says is unusual.</li>
<li>Paca explains that she needs extra money and offers to work for him. Rafeeq explains that he doesn't lead a gang and that his colleague <a href="../Setting/Cheryll.html">Cheryll</a> &quot;doesn't get the memo sometimes,&quot; apologizing for her attempt to mug Paca.</li>
<li>Rafeeq claims that he does lead a local neighborhood watch that deals with both unseemly mortals as well as supernatural beings (e.g. vampires, werewolves, mages, ghosts).</li>
<li>Paca texts <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> to take a rain check on the hunt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> explains the situation with <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> to <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. The two agree to spend that evening patrolling the Shadow.
<ul>
<li>Dade spends 1 Essence (putting him at 9) to cross into the Shadow. Little Shadow is at Harmony 3 and can cross effortlessly.</li>
<li>As they cross, they meet <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>, who has seen what Hanzer-gah Ninna's presence have left behind in the Pack's territory in the Shadow. Unseen Fire leads them to the manhole covering the sewers where the Pack previously fought the Beshilu. In the Shadow, the manhole is huge and covered in First Tongue writings about the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a>.</li>
<li>Dade lifts the manhole cover, and the Pack detects the scent of smoke, fire, and burned rat. Unseen Fire believes he has grown more powerful to be able to do this on his own, more powerful even than she.</li>
<li>Unseen Fire leads Dade and Little Shadow to other places bearing more marks of burning and huge wolf paw prints scorched into the ground with fire. Spirits hide in fear as they pass.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for session attendance.</li>
<li>Those who helped with recap (me) take 1 Beat for that.</li>
<li>Dade takes 2 Beats for making progress toward the aspirations of going on a Sacred Hunt for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> and helping <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> to see his parents again, putting him at 30 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Key mentioned that &quot;Blades in the Dark&quot; is a good resource for games with a large number of factions during a discussion about our game having a lot of elements that are introduced and then go unused for extended periods of time.</li>
<li>Does Obsidian have graph functionality? Would it be possible to have a communal Obsidian vault for the game where we'd use this graph functionality to map relationships between entities in the game?
<ul>
<li>Obsidian has graph functionality. Synchronizing changes between multiple users using the same file store could be problematic.</li>
