<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> receives a letter at their apartment with no return address, with the Latin &quot;Lupus et Fidelis&quot; scrawled on it. The letter seems to assure Wren of the church's worship of and loyalty to them. It's signed by <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>. Wren pins the note to their fridge.</li>
<li>Wren is also visited by their friend Rebecca, who asks if Wren had fun like she asked them to. Wren relates a bit about their night with Miguel. Rebecca mentions worriedly about them having to &quot;hide her for a bit longer&quot; and the possibility of &quot;getting in trouble with Mother again.&quot; She calls Wren her &quot;best friend.&quot; The two discuss plans for the day and entertain the idea of going for a walk, but Rebecca declines on the premise of avoiding Mother.</li>
<li>Rebecca discovers the letter from Lupus et Fidelis and says &quot;they can't be allowed to continue&quot; because she feels they are a threat to Wren. She seems to approve of Wren bringing the matter up with both packs, the Crescent Shadows and the Cadillac Company. Rebecca mentions Wren being Uratha and alludes to &quot;what I am,&quot; implying that she is not.</li>
<li>Wren sees a vision of some kind portraying an SUV on the street below covered in blood and running people over. Rebecca seems disturbed by this, for her own safety. Wren then sees the vision again, with Paca on top of the SUV in the middle of the woods. They then leave Rebecca to stay in the apartment and go to find Paca and the SUV.</li>
<li>Paca manages to rip the hood off of Walker Breaker, which stops spinning and aims itself for a large thick tree. In the midst of the fight, Paca recalls a memory of her husband, who was killed when he was run over by a car.</li>
<li>Dade, Clara, and Wren flee the flight to the edge of the woods. Clara awakens. The three make their way away from the main road to a nearby clearing next to a river.</li>
<li>Paca awakens in human form lying in a ditch, undamaged but sore, nursing a migraine and sour stomach. It's afternoon. She finds the car an absolute wreck, nearly torn to shreds by Paca's claws and having nearly taken down a tree; it's been rendered silent and unusable. She attempts unsuccessfully to hitchhike and walks back to town into the night, with a full moon rising.</li>
<li>A glowing lion with stars in its eyes exits the woods to Paca's side. It dips its head, then proceeds to walk alongside Paca at pace. Paca attempts to speak to it in First Tongue, and it responds by licking her on the forehead, then whispers to her in First Tongue, &quot;Be known as Glorious, for your fight against a Magath who would defy the natural order. Well done, Irraka. The Mother has been watching; She is proud.&quot;</li>
<li>The lion then tells Paca about &quot;a sister of ours&quot; named <em>Fur Ansac</em> (&quot;Broken Mirror&quot;), and says that, should Paca encounter her, to tell her &quot;the Mother wishes for her to return.&quot;</li>
<li>The lion then openly approaches the other three of the Pack in the woods. He is of the Rahu Lim, the Warrior Lunes. He approaches Dade first, licks him on his right hand, and says, &quot;Be known as Glorious for your fight.&quot; He then approaches Clara in turn with the same. Both gain the option to take a point of Renown in Glory.</li>
<li>A stereotypical ninja of sorts places his hands on the shoulders of Clara and Wren, saying in First Tongue, &quot;Be known as Honorable, for servicing a pack that is not your own with good intent.&quot; The two figures then vanish.</li>
<li>Paca reaches a hotel on foot, pays for a room for the night, takes a shower, checks the news for any relevant events (and finds nothing), and goes to sleep.</li>
<li>Dade returns to his apartment with Clara, putting her on his bed. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> seems upset about something, but takes Dade's suggestion to wait until the morning to speak about it. The three sleep there that night, recovering 1 Willpower.</li>
<li>Wren has an odd dream that takes place in an abandoned warehouse wherein they are unable to smell anything.</li>
<li>Little Shadow asks about Clara and Wren during breakfast, but is noticeably cool in demeanor and doesn't say much to Dade.</li>
<li>It's now Sunday. Wren and Clara depart Dade's apartment. Dade and Little Shadow have a difficult conversation about the fate of <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> and his connection with the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a>: want of vengeance for the fate of the original Crescent Shadows at the latter's hand. Dade explains his decision to banish Hanzer-gah Ninna. Little Shadow takes it hard and is conflicted, but ultimately seems to understand.</li>
<li>Paca returns home and explains the absence of the car as it having been stolen. Miguel asks her to explain her frequent late-night disappearances, which she explains away as having taken a second job at the Amazon warehouse downtown to help fund a future trip to London for Miguel.</li>
<li>Miguel makes Paca promise not to hide anything else from him, but then attempts to hide his relationship with Wren. Paca openly assumes that he's seeing Clara. Miguel then texts Wren, explaining the situation and asking if Wren wants to continue. They acknowledge that they do, and the two arrange to meet again on Tuesday. Wren then puts together that the car Miguel used to take them home was the same car that they saw Walker Breaker inhabiting.</li>
