<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The Pack encounters a Verge and hunts <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> with <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a>. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> discovers that <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> lured <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> out into the open, allowing the Pack to dispatch him. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> is reassured by her spirit, then visits <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a> and learns something new about him.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> each attempt to track <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>. Dade expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 4) for the tracking check (Wits 3 + Survival 1 - 5 + 3 for 1 Willpower), getting 1 success. Paca also gets 1. Clara gets 3 and gains the Invisible Predator Condition (p. 308). <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> likewise succeeds with the group.</li>
<li>The Gauntlet is almost nonexistent in the area of town in which the Pack finds itself, allowing Spirit and Flesh to cross without barrier. The Shadow seeps in, causing the Spirit and Flesh to be almost one and the same. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> recognize this as a dangerous Verge (see &quot;Gauntlet Strength,&quot; p. 101). <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> indicates that the Azlu (see p. 203) would be needed to seal it, and are generally hesitant to work with Uratha. The group resolves to leave that matter for another day and proceed with the Hunt.</li>
<li>With the help of <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>, the Pack continues stealthily tracking <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> through the Verge. The Pack hears a voice, but only one of them recognizes it: <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> hears her husband Patrick. The voice cycles from that of a friend of <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> to a coworker of Paca's. The scent of <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> is very close.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> accidently steps on a twig, sending a loud cracking sound through the air followed by a palpable silence. After a moment, the Pack hears the flapping of <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>'s wings as it flies into view, sees them all, and lands nearby, cocking his head.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> says in First Tongue, mimicking the voice of <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>, &quot;There's nothing for you here. I'm minding my own business.&quot; <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> retorts that <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> was doing the same before <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> kidnapped him.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> draws her resolver and attempts (with 2 successes) to shoot <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>, but only grazes him. &quot;Now that was a mistake,&quot; he says with the voice of <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>. Paca freezes in fear, unable to move (for 3 turns).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> attempts to take hold of <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>'s mind, but he resists her.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> screams in fury, endowing the Pack with a +1 rating to Brawl and Weaponry attacks that also upgrades the damage of such attacks to Lethal.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 1 Essence (putting him at 7) to shift reflexively into Gauru form, then goes into an all-out attack against <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>, striking him for 3 Lethal damage. <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> screams in surprise and pain in the voice of <a href="../Setting/Michael%20Stantz.html">Michael Stantz</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> snarls in First Tongue, &quot;Let no sacred place in your territory be violated,&quot; reciting his tribal oath. He attempts to use a gift, but fails.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> screeches, summoning a murder of crows to attack the Pack at his bidding.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> again attempts to take hold of <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>'s mind, but is foiled.</li>
<li>The crows converge on <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, pecking him and dealing 1 Bashing damage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> attempts to bite <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>, but he dodges.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> heals the 1 Bashing damage dealt to him by the crows, then swipes at <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> again, but misses.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> successfully uses his Knotted Paths (p. 129) gift on <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>, entrapping him in the area for a day.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> attacks <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, dealing 3 Lethal damage to him.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> breaks out of her fear, shifts reflexively into Gauru form, and attacks <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>, striking where his wing meets his body and raking across his chest, spilling forth liquid Essence. &quot;But he wanted this,&quot; he says in <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s voice as he stumbles backward.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> shifts into Urshul and bites at <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>, dealing 5 Lethal damage. She sinks her fangs into his neck and rips out his throat. <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> screams in torment and surprise using <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a>'s voice. His control over the crows is released and they disperse. After a moment, he explodes in a flood of black feathers, leaving behind a flood of 20 Essence (<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> takes 1, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> takes 3, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> takes 8, <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> takes 2, <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> takes 1).</li>
<li>The Pack hears <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s voice: &quot;Mister Collector, sir, is it okay to come out?&quot; <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> revert into Hishu form. &quot;Mom?!&quot; Miguel calls out. &quot;What are you doing out here with strange bird-men?&quot; Paca asks him. Miguel apparently got it into his head that he might convince <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> to stay in one place long enough for the Pack to attack him. Paca's arms drops to her sides, both impressed and deeply concerned. Miguel had also hoped to ascertain the spirit's original reason for kidnapping him.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is able to detect that <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> is himself, but is still affected by Lunacy and not of his normal mind. The Pack notices an ethereal chain attached to his head with <a href="../Setting/Youthful%20Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a> on the other end of it, urging him along. Miguel isn't fettered, but has been influenced. Once he sees the Pack, particularly the look on Paca's face, he shudders and withdraws. In First Tongue, he says, &quot;I didn't know! He was just curious, and wanting to know things.&quot; Paca yells at him (in First Tongue) to leave. The spirit begins to sob, then turns and runs away.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> see the remains of <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> and seems extremely impressed that the Pack killed him. <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> hugs <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, giving her his thanks for making the kill. The Pack retires to Panera for a post-hunt meal together. By the meal's conclusion, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> has healed the damage done to him by <a href="../Setting/Su%20Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> seems her spirit in twilight, watching and grinning, brushing up against her legs and saying, &quot;Not bad, sister. Not bad at all. I might even call myself jealous. See, this is why what we do is important, and why that Rage is important: so you can take out suckers like that. But, it's still up to you. Regardless of what you do, I love you.&quot;</li>
<li>By now, it's been 4 days since the mission to the church of <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>.</li>
<li>When <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> returns to his apartment, he does research on matters of Lunacy, the Occult, and psychology in attempt to help <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. (Thunder will do her own research and get back to me on this.)</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> goes to visit <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a>, who says he's feeling a lot better. He mentions still having sporadic strange dreams. Clara also detects an odd smell to him, one that seems to indicate he is not fully human. She suspects, though isn't certain, that he may be wolf-blooded, similar to what ghouls are for vampires: something inbetween human and Uratha. He is likely immune to Delirium and has his own special abilities. Clara asks if Alex has felt strangely. He seems eager for non-hospital food and curious to know what mischief she's gotten into in his absence. Both seem ready for Alex to return home.</li>
