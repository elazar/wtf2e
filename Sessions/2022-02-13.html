<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> patrol the Pack's territory and attempt to track <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>. They discover that the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> is already hunting him and that he's apparently traveled through the junkyard where the Pack found <a href="../Setting/Walker%20Breaker.html">Walker Breaker</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Background music is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYsEose4dXA&amp;list=PLj6dsO9Ljj7v2dUybbR_YowcHinimBx_d">Kai Engel - Cendres playlist</a>.</li>
<li>We begin at the same moment we left, on the far northwest side of the Pack's territory below the Detroit Golf Club. For reference, the eastern corner that touches the Polish Art Center is near the Smokey Bottle Bar. We determined that HQ is roughly in the center of the territory.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> are standing over the manhole cover of the lair of the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a>, covered in strange runes that may originate from a cult. Despite the marks, the lair has no longer has the scent of the Beshilu.</li>
<li>The group begins a patrol sweep toward the east, intending to circle the territory clockwise and eventually end up at HQ.</li>
<li>They move into a neighborhood of buildings within the territory that are abandoned in the Flesh, but less so in the Shadow. Spirits of electricity and water are present, but have a smaller presence and are quieter than normal; the stronger spirits in the area are those of blight. There's an odd sense of acceptance toward letting the area fall back to the effects of nature.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> succeeds on a Perception (Wits + Composure) check with 3 successes. He notices scorch marks and the lingering scent of fire and smoke, specifically from houses that have burned and even in the cement itself, but after a failed Wits + Streewise / Survival check, he can't deduce their age. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> believes their are approximately five months old and from <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, suspecting he's becoming more fire than wolf.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> both attempt Wits + Streetwise / Survival + 3 check to attempt to track <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> and gets 3 successes each, and pick up on his scent right away. They continue following burn and scorch marks, many of them in the shape of a wolf paw. They come to a completely burned-down house, just ash and rubble, crawling with bright spirits, some especially large ones fighting each other for the area's remaining Essence.</li>
<li>The group keeps their distance, remaining hidden from the spirits, and attempts to stealthily circles the house. As they pass through, they see one larger spirit with four rows of teeth decapitate another smaller spirit over a prize of Essence. The spirits are wandering, like a group of nomads, consuming residual Essence from all the abandoned buildings in the area.</li>
<li>The group finds where the trail continues on the opposite side of the ruined house and begins finding footprints with embers remaining in them. Remaining spirits are all of blight, running rampant through the area, but the group manages to avoid them. The footprints stop abruptly at the end of the neighborhood on the mid-northern end of the territory, as if <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> suddenly vanished into thin air. The hedge spirit of the Shadow shows the deathly effects of blight here, but not fire.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> uses the Spirit Whispers ability of his <a href="../System/Crescent%20Moon's%20Gift.html">Crescent Moon's Gift</a>, using 1 Essence (putting him at 8) on the hedge spirit, but it will only say that <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> went &quot;through.&quot; Dade assumes this means he somehow returned to the Flesh. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> and <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> are able to cross over immediately; Dade must double back to a nearby locus, a fire hydrant near a playground, to cross over.</li>
<li>As he walks, he notices small eyes that he recognizes from the subterranean battle with the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a>, following him with their gaze. As he fades into to the Flesh, Dade notices a rat at his feet looking up at him. Its gaze looks far too intelligent, trembling but not fleeing, with some of its back fur singed off. Dade speaks to it, and it says that the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> is now hunting <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>.</li>
<li>Upon relaying the episode with the rat to <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, he lets out a more-colorful-than-usual Uratha swear word. The group continues following the trail to the edge of town until they come to the same junkyard where the Pack found <a href="../Setting/Walker%20Breaker.html">Walker Breaker</a>.</li>
<li>The group finds a man digging through the garbage with charred clothing, with black hair and nails that are far too long. Dade has the group hang back and approaches the man. An exchange with him implies that he knows that <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> is Uratha. As Dade approaches the man to see if he is Uratha (Wits + Primal Urge, 1 success), the man lands a punch on him for 1 Bashing damage. Dade is able to tell that the man is not Uratha or wolf-blood.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> returns to the group and they attempt to navigate around the junkyard and relocate <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>'s trail on the other side.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Dade takes 1 Beat for session attendance and 1 Beat for session recap.</li>
<li>For progress toward going on a Sacred Hunt for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, Dade takes 1 Beat, putting him at 33 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Bottle Spirit rite (p. 140) is taught to <a href="../System/Tribe.html#Bone+Shadows">Bone Shadows</a>, of which <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> is one. It may not be powerful enough to contain a spirit like <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, and it would only do so temporarily, but it may still be useful.</li>
<li>I don't think we ever learned what tribe <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> is from.
<ul>
<li>Thunder clarified during session that he is a <a href="../System/Tribe.html#Hunters+in+Darkness">Hunter in Darkness</a>.</li>

<li>Reminder: <a href="https://www.watchparty.me">WatchParty</a> is the site we use to play music during game.</li>
