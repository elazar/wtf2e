<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Background music is <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=e8zZyMZA94Q">God of War OST - Magni and Modi [Extended]</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> see roofs of houses nearby spontaneously catch fire before <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> materializes in the Flesh in front of them with two blighted hound spirits, leaving a narrow avenue of escape back the way the Pack came.</li>
<li>He opens his mouth and shoots a stream of flame toward <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, dealing 4 lethal damage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> gets bitten by one of the blight hounds, taking 2 Lethal damage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> very quickly gives <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> her blessing to bring her into the Pack so that Pack Rites -- the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> in particular -- will apply to her. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> bites her hand and draws blood to perform the ritual and takes lead of the hunt, with <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> as the prey.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> topples a fire hydrant, causing water to erupt from the base. It makes contact with the blight hounds, who begin smoking, howl in pain, and give the Pack a wide berth. With a deathly glare from <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, one backs out of the fight completely.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> steals some Essence from <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> for himself.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> uses his Hunt of Fire and Ice gift, spending 5 Essence (putting him at 3) and getting 11 successes in 3 attempts (1, 8, 2). (Normally, it would take 5 turns to bring this gift online due to the limit of spending 1 Essence per turn and he wouldn't be able to choose between heat and cold, but Thunder opted to allow it in this instance.)</li>
<li>The gift causes a blizzard to spontaneously appear, extending for three miles. It kicks up a heavy wind, puts out the roof fires, and causes building debris to go free-falling. A bit of window shard hits <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> for 1 Bashing damage. Seeing this, the last blight hound also withdraws.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> casts a deathly glare, paralyzing all Pack members save for <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> with fear and leaving them speechless for one turn. He tries appealing to his past with <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, who refuses to be swayed and shifts. <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> then drains 4 Essence from <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> before the Pack regains their ability to move.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> charges <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> and bites his tail just before <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> slashes at one of his front paws; each deal 1 Bashing damage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 1 Essence (putting him at 2) and uses his Shadow Gaze ability to learn that <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>'s bane is mementos from the <a href="../Setting/Crescent%20Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a>, which he yells over to <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, hoping he has something that would qualify.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> breathes fire at <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, dealing 3 Lethal damage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> bites at <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>'s other leg, dealing another 1 Bashing damage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> attempts another attack, but dramatically fails, gaining the Shaken condition (p. 310).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>SHAKEN</p>
<p>Something has frightened your character extensively. Any time your character is taking an action where that fear might hinder her, you may opt to fail the roll (before you've made the roll) and shed this Condition. This Condition can be imposed by a successful breaking point roll.</p>
<p><strong>Example Skills</strong>: Brawl, Firearms, Intimidation, Weaponry
<strong>Resolution</strong>: Fail a roll, as noted.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> shifts again, this time into Gauru.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> bites into <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>'s leg again, causing him to roar in pain despite it only causing Bashing damage (presumably due to the source).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> retreats into the Shadow in attempt to escape the forming prison of <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s Shadowbind Rite, but it holds him in place. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> locate a nearby house containing a locus: a mug with an affinity for winter. Each of <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gain 5 Essence (putting him at 7).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> attempts to attack at <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> again and fails, also gaining the Shaken condition. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> attempts to do the same and also fails, but resolves her Shaken condition. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> attacks again, dealing another 1 Bashing damage. <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> drains 2 more Essence from <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>, causing her to shrink.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is struck by <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> and suffers the Madness condition (p. 309), causing the latter to appear to the former as a huge almagamation of her deepest fears and nightmares.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>MADNESS (PERSISTENT)</p>
<p>Your character saw or did something that jarred her loose from reality. This isn't a mental illness born of brain chemistry -- that, at least, might be treatable. This madness is the product of supernatural tampering or witnessing something that humanity was never meant to comprehend. The Storytell has a pool of dice equal to 10 - (character's Integrity). Once per chapter, the Storyteller can apply those dice as a negative modifier to any Mental or Social roll made for the character.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Sources</strong>: Supernatural visions, losing a dot of Integrity.
<strong>Resolution</strong>: Regain a dot of Integrity, lose <em>another</em> dot of Integrity, or achieve an exceptional success on a breaking point.
<strong>Beat</strong>: The character fails a roll because of this Condition.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> hits <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> yet again for another 1 Bashing damage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> falls into Basu-Im, and <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> follows in turn. <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> projects a hallucination of <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> into <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s perception, but it fails to sway her.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> is burned by <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, taking another 3 Lethal damage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> hits <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> for another 1 Bashing damage. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> follows suit for another 2 Bashing damage. <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> drains another 1 Essence from <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 4 Willpower (putting him at 1) and cites a Latin curse to perform the <a href="../System/Shadowbind.html">Shadowbind</a> rite, getting 11 successes against <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>'s 5 in 5 attempts and trapping him in a diamond of ice. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gains the Symbolic Focus condition (p. 311).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> falls to Basu-Im. With <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> trapped, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> all turn their attention to <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, the only Pack member no longer in Basu-Im.</li>
<li>
<del>Because <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> is trapped, the Hunt is technically not over.</del> <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> has healed 1 Lethal damage by this point, putting him at 3 Lethal damage. We end at the top of the combat round with <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> last in initiative. He can use <a href="../System/Feet%20of%20Mist.html">Feet of Mist</a> or willingly give in to Basu-Im (which would help heal his current Lethal damage).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for attendance, 1 Beat for recap, and 3 for the battle, putting Dade at 43.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Per the rules of <a href="../System/Shadowbind.html">Shadowbind</a>, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> must tell at least two others of how to break the binding within an hour of the ritual. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/John%20Selby.html">John Selby</a> maybe?</li>
