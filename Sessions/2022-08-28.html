<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> takes a call from <a href="../Setting/Mason.html">Mason</a>, apologizes to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, and has a chat with <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> has a realization after talking with <a href="../Setting/Youthful%20Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a> and makes a big life change. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> fill each other in on <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>. The Pack meets to go after the Collector.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> travels to Belle Island, feeling agitation and anxiety with themself for what's transpired (see <a href="2022-06-26.html">2022-06-26</a>, <a href="2022-07-03.html">2022-07-03</a>, and the end of <a href="2022-07-31.html">2022-07-31</a>). They receive a call from <a href="../Setting/Mason.html">Mason</a>. He calls Wren &quot;Bella,&quot; saying that he's learning Italian. He asks about their well-being and tries to offer some reassurance and comfort. The two plan to meet for a date later and order in take-out.</li>
<li>After hanging up the call, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> catches the smell of a Pure, then looks up to see <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> looking at them with a very unhostile, curious, and pitying expression, and assures Wren (seemingy truthfully) of his peaceful intentions.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> asks <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> if they're alright, instigating a rather crazed laugh and a reply that they have no idea. When asked what precipitated this state of mind, Wren genuinely says they don't know what their tipping point was.</li>
<li>They admit to feeling lost; <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> seems to empathize with them, saying &quot;that night tore my whole life to shreds and I didn't know what to do.&quot; He tells them that the feeling eventually goes away when one finds their own answers and truth.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> says he isn't present with them to proselytize, only to listen and help them &quot;find your feet again.&quot; The two relate on the nature of Uratha being an inner struggle between two conflicting halves and the notion of predestination. &quot;Foresight is a gift many people would call insanity,&quot; Graves says. &quot;I wonder if 'we're all mad here,''&quot; <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> replies.</li>
<li>The two continue to converse about the nature of existence. &quot;A beast am I, lest a beast I become,&quot; <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> quotes from an unknown source that they feel may aptly summarize their state of mind on the subject. They go on to question the idea of growth, believing that perhaps everyone is a child playing with something they don't understand, straying a bit into nihilistic notions. <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> states that, if the Pure and Forsaken agree on nothing else, there will always be the Hunt; Wren agrees. The two wish each other good hunting and part ways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, basically apologizing and saying that things have been crazy. &quot;Either the world has gone mad, or I have,&quot; they say. After a while, Paca responds saying, &quot;It happens to everyone; just don't do it again.&quot; Wren replies that they can't promise anything, but will try their best.</li>
<li>Later that night, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> gives her a date a last peck on the cheek before disappearing into her apartment, retiring to bed for the best sleep she's had in a while.</li>
<li>After departing from the <a href="../Setting/Amber%20Club.html">Amber Club</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> asking if the two can meet. Dade responds, telling her she can swing by his apartment. As she enters, she sees <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> precociously nibbling on some bacon.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> tells <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> that she suspects that <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> is a Host, but she isn't sure what kind. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> suddenly seems much more attentive. Clara continues to explain that he's using some manner of slime to thicken the Gauntlet and isn't sure of his motive.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> summarizes his research to <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> (see <a href="2022-08-14.html">2022-08-14</a>). She says that the Uratha that work for him seem happy with the arrangement, but she's uncertain if he is influencing their feelings. She asks if he thinks that <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> is &quot;safe.&quot; Dade replies that he doesn't know, and expresses misgivings about either of them placing themselves in his employ. He advises her to think hard about seeking out any other avenues she might have toward what she's looking for.</li>
<li>Before she leaves, <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> gives <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> a hug, saying in First Tongue that he missed her and asking if the two can go hunting rabbits sometime. She chuckles, being reminded of her spirit, and says &quot;sure.&quot; The three discuss possibly going for a Hunt soon. Little Shadow pulls <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> in for a group hug, saying he's glad they're his packmates and that he doesn't feel alone anymore. Clara departs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> asking him to meet, bringing Smashburger for him. Dade explains the situation with <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>. Selby mentions that <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Elodoth">Elodoth</a> are good at connections and suggests an indirect approach by dismantling <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>'s resources rather than attacking him directly.</li>
<li>The night passes. Everyone recovers one Willpower, putting <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> at 5.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> takes <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> to school and then goes to work. She converses with <a href="../Setting/Youthful%20Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a>, who asks about her job and why she does it.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> eventually admits that she's not happy, doesn't feel like she's accomplished anything, and says that <a href="../Setting/Youthful%20Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a> is right in asking why she does it.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> throws her laptop at the wall, grabs her purse, and walks out, exclaiming &quot;I'm done!&quot; at anyone who tries to stop or question her.</li>
<li>At <a href="../Setting/Youthful%20Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a>'s suggestion, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> goes for ice cream, but declines its request to possess her or someone else. As the spirit continues its chatter, she pretends to carry on a conversation on her cell phone, to keep up appearances.</li>
<li>After the ice cream outing, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> returns home, and quitting her job and her sudden loss of income hits her full force. (She removes her Resources 2 background and gains 2 XP). After watching TV and taking a nap, she sends a text to the Pack asking them what's going on. She, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> plan to meet at HQ later that evening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the Pack arrives at HQ, they find <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> appearing healed, but nervous. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> does his best to reassure her.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> fills <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> in on everything related to <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>. She asks if he's got money, and Dade tells her he's the richest man in the city, which seems to make her rather jovial.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> mentions <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>'s desire to hunt. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> brings up the Collector and asks after <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>. The Pack resolves not to act against him, believing that those caring for him are likely to dismiss his tirades as the ramblings of someone with mental illness.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> receives a text from Marcus urging her for a timeframe for her decision of whether to be in his employ. She replies that she'll take a week or two to think about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Pack decides to go on the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> for the Collector. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> to have him join the hunt with them. Because the hunt is for a spirit and because she is of the <a href="../System/Tribe.html#Bone+Shadows">Bone Shadow</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> handles casting the ritual.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for showing up.</li>
<li>Those who submit #stars-and-wishes get 1 Beat.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gets 1 Beat for gathering more information on <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> from <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, putting him at 37 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>It's an interesting dichotomy in our present game that, on the one hand, we have <a href="../Setting/Sister%20Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>, who can spontaneously instigate Death Rage, and on the other, we have <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>, who can quell it. And the Pack is at best at frenemy status with both of them...</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> now has the Fog of War (p. 124).</li>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Star: The scene with <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> quitting her job while being cheered on by <a href="../Setting/Youthful%20Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a> was incredibly satisfying. I'm looking forward to seeing what she resorts to doing for income...</li>
<li>Star: I enjoyed the conversation between <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>, even if I'm not quite sure how to feel about it. I wouldn't have pegged Graves for being an empathetic nor sympathetic character, yet here we are.</li>
<li>Star: Looking forward to (perhaps) finally closing the chapter on the Collector! Can't wait to see what happens with this next session.</li>
<li>Wish: <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> not being a member of the <a href="../Setting/Crescent%20Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a> is making the sessions feel a bit disjointed. Perhaps if something happened to a number of members of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>, it might make Wren more inclined to join forces with the Pack...</li>
<li>Wish: Is it just me, or do things between <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> seem a bit... awkward? I like that they exchanged information on <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>. Dade certainly wants to help Clara, and she seems grateful for his desire to do so, even if a bit unsure of how to respond to it or inclined to keep herself at arm's length despite it...</li>
