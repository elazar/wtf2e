<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Background music is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgQwst5OFmA">Kai Engel - Brume</a>.</li>
<li>Last session ended on Monday with a half moon. It's now Tuesday.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> attempts to investigate whether it's possible for a Uratha to revert to being fully human, intending to offer whatever knowledge he can find to <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> should she make it more obvious that it's her wish to do so. Among the wolves, one name comes up: the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>, which is located in pack-neutral territory. It's a prestigious place run by a man known for his neutrality. Rumor has it he can permanently quell Death Rage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> contacts <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a>, who says he's never been to the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>; too rich for his blood. He drops <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>'s name as someone who might patronize the place. He knows Magpie Man as <a href="../Setting/Su Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> (Soo Oo-bay) in First Tongue, which translates to &quot;The Collector&quot; or &quot;He Who Gathers Up.&quot; The spirit took Selby's sister before she realized what it was. He suspects it didn't realize that Dade was Uratha before taking hold of him, then let go when it realized its mistake.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> goes to meet with <a href="../Setting/Samuel Hanselman.html">Samuel Hanselman</a> and takes <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> with him, hiding their injuries behind a blindfold. He asks after their injuries, and they simply respond that they got too close to another Uratha -- they do reluctantly specify <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> by name -- in Death Rage. Samuel mentions that the news apparently covered the blizzard that occurred during the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a>' fight with <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, expresses his concern about Wren continuing to associate with them, and reemphasizes that the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> is their true pack.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Samuel Hanselman.html">Samuel Hanselman</a> presents <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> with a Tracker's Lantern fetish (p. 147) in the form of a blue sandstone glass eye and places it (painfully) in Wren's right eye socket. He notes that it requires Essence to use, but short of extreme circumstances, it should stay put. The two share a moment when Samuel indicates that he only wishes the best for Wren and wants to help them however he can. Thunder noted that this would be good cause to get the Striking Looks merit (p. 113), but Wren already has it. Wren's eyes heal, with the one containing the fetish healing around it.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> receives a text from <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq.html">Rafeeq</a> asking if she's free the next night to help them keep the vigil; she responds that she'll be there.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> goes to visit <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a> at the hospital, but finds him asleep. She notices a thin nightmare spirit there with them, presumably influencing her brother. Clara tries to usher him away, denying his plees to feed, but he refuses. She then spends 1 Essence to flare her Renown runes, revealing her ranking in the spirit world to this spirit, causing it to ripple away in fear back into the Shadow.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> then wakes <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a> from his nightmare, which he tells her was about their parents and Clara leaving him, saying they never wanted to see him again. She tries to comfort him. He complains about the hospital food; Clara offers to sneak something better to him. The two chat about recent happenings. Alex asks if Clara has a boyfriend, which she denies.</li>
<li>Night falls. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> tells <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> she's going for a run, then shifts into Urhan form and travels to a firearms store to purchase a gun. When asked by the clerk, she fabricates a story about recently being witness to a mugging and wanting to purchase a firearm for self-defense; he believes her. He allows her to purchase a small revolver. She leaves the store, shifts back into Urhan form, returns home, and sleeps.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> attempts to converse with the spirit in their fetish, but it seems quite unhappy to be trapped there and repeatedly swears death against all Uratha.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> sees a news report about a recent missing person, <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>, but notices nothing particularly unusually about the report. He feeds <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> hamburgers for dinner. Eating processed food is no longer a trigger for him because he is above Harmony 3. He remains under a ban for speaking First Tongue. Dade attempts to reacclimate him to speaking English to be able to communicate with his parents himself, but he isn't able to and becomes frustrated. However, he also doesn't seem entirely forthcoming about why he can't speak English.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> go to HQ. Dade takes 1 Essence from the locus to bring his pool to full. The two slip into the Shadow, and Dade questions spirits near the locus. One of them, a human-sized construct of glass and metal, gets his attention and offers information on <a href="../Setting/Su Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a> in exchange for Dade slicing his hand open to appease the spirit's penchant for pain, which Dade does. In the process, he takes 1 Lethal damage (which he should be able to heal in 15 minutes). The spirit points northwest toward the new Center Pallace Shopping Center downtown, outside the pack's territory but unclaimed, then takes its leave. Dade and Little Shadow continue on their way toward the shopping center.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> converses with <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> briefly about the planned surveillance mission to the church the next night.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> has misgivings about their current mission, which appears to be to spy on the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a> for the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. They visit with <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>, who can tell something is bothering them. They explain that they feel some allegiance to the Crescent Shadows and feel like continuing their mission feels like betraying them, even for their own pack. They feel more connection to the Crescent Shadows in only a few weeks despite having been a member of the Cadillac Company for two years. Rebecca reemphasizes her support regardless of the choice they make, saying that it only matters if they're together and Wren is happy. Rebecca convinces Wren to allow her &quot;spike the dopamine&quot; for them; they eventually relent, and suffer the Stunned tilt (p. 313) and the Swooning condition (p. 311) for four days. Rebecca glows as she administers whatever it is. Wren goes to bed at her behest.</li>
<li>At home, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is relaxing when <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> is summoned by a voice from outside that sounds like it belongs to a friend of his, Timothy, trying to coax him out to go see &quot;A Quiet Place.&quot; Miguel tries to convince Paca to let him go, but she refuses and shooes the voice away. Paca notices that the voice appears to have a Spanish accent. She asks Miguel where Timothy is from, only to be told that he lives about 20 minutes away. After a moment, she calls out to Timothy to confirm she can see him, then relents and allows Miguel to go. As he leaves, she sees bird talons grab him and drag him back. As she runs out of the house, she sees a huge bipedal creature taller than her with a twisting gate and surprisingly swift, covered in plummage seemingly from a variety of birds. The face contains a pair of button black eyes and a cruel smile across its beak. The bird drags Miguel into the Gauntlet and disappears.</li>

</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Star: Paca finally got a gun! Seems like it's been an aspiration of hers for a while. Also interesting seeing how she's dividing her time between the pack and the hunter cell.</li>
<li>Star: Enjoyed seeing Wren's ruminations on their loyalties between the two packs. Very curious about who and what Rebecca really is, though not sure if the opportunity to ask will come up in game.</li>
<li>Wish: Didn't feel like we saw a lot of Clara this session. Had hoped to see her quest to find Death Wolf progress or for her to perhaps feel less ambivalent about her nature as Uratha.</li>
<li>Wish: More content in the #news-and-rumors channel. It was used once near the start of the chronicle for the news report about the Smokey Bottle Bar incident and once for news articles about the Magpie Man, but not much since.</li>
<li>Wish: More content in the #allies channel; there currently is none. That seems bad, whether it's because content exists and just hasn't been added yet or because we don't have any allies.</li>
