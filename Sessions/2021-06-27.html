<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The Pack is exonerated by the spirit court of Hope, begins the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a>, and locates a Ridden.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>It's a new moon. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> is at Harmony 3. A dog shows up at <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s apartment. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> explains that he used a Gift to get the dog to join the pack; she can identify and obey all members of the Pack. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> goes to fetch the McD's meal that he owes <a href="../Setting/John%20Selby.html">John Selby</a> for the intelligence on <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>. They name her <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> observes that the situation with <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> doesn't appear to have wavered: he still has a lot of fan obsession and positivity focused on him. He's keeping clear of the Smokey Bottle Bar for now, for safety reasons. <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> is paid a visit by <a href="../Setting/Future%20Elric.html">Future Elric</a>, who now looks older and more serious. He cautions <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> that he's out of balance and needs to not lean so heavily toward the Flesh and to visit the Shadow with him. He's temporarily stunned, but the condition passes.</li>
<li>The Pack meets at headquarters after dark, with the new dog in tow. She is christened <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> for her German shepherd-like appearance. <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> is able to shift into the Shadow effortlessly without a locus. The rest of the Pack follows suit, taking Essence from the locus. (Dade takes 3, putting him at 10.)</li>
<li>The spirit court of Hope convenes in the White Rose Center, a community center that doubles as a soup kitchen. It exudes a feeling of enforced order and a sense of progress, constant improvement, and being whole. The Pack is greeted by a small spirit creature that presents itself as Curiosity, who apparently likes <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a>'s inquisitivity. As they enter a courtroom-like area, <a href="../Setting/Future%20Elric.html">Future Elric</a> appears and takes up a position as an attorney would. The spirit that <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> strong-armed for information about <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> is in the jury.</li>
<li>The spirit court of Hope reveals that <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> is a great source of Essence for them. The Pack argues points for the elimination of <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, and each spend 1 Essence to reveal their Renown markings in all their glowing silvery glory to the court. Each member also receives a condition as a result.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> receives Cunning</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> receives Honorable</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> receives Wise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The spirit court of Hope proclaims the Pack innocent in the matter of the attack instigated by <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, then several of them vanish. They speak with a red satyr-like spirit named Ambitious Heart, who congratulates them on passing the test and saying that the court will offer their help. It confirms that lunes guard the church, albeit few of them. The Pack will need to come up with sources of hope to provide the court with the Essence they will lose by the cult being driven from town. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gives 2 Essence to the spirit he strong-armed to make amends, putting him at 8.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> leads the Pack on a Hunt for a Ridden, ideally one possessed by one of the cannibal spirits unleashed by <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>. The Pack gains the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> condition, and a Storm Lords benefit that aids them in identifying Claimed, Urged, and Possessed. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is able to gain the scent of the prey, so the Pack has a location: an alleyway near a closed restaurant.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> both commit a dramatic failure in sneaking up on the spirit and identify it as Claimed, a ripped woman with a meat cleaver, soulless eyes, and blood on her lips, with twisted dogs at her side. They shift into Dalu, detecting an odor of blood and rotten flesh as they do.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 1 Beat for session recap.</li>
<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 1 Beat for session attendance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> earn 1 Beat for a dramatic failure.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> receives 1 Beat for fulfilling the short-term Aspiration of meeting with the spirit court of Hope, leaving him with 8 Beats, and replaces it with completing a <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a>.</li>
</ul>
