<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> survive their encounter with the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> and encounter two new prospective packmates, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>After some discussion with Thunder, we decided to change the Touchstone for <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, as &quot;The Wilds&quot; doesn't make much sense in-game due to Detroit's lack of proximity to wilderness. His Touchstone is now &quot;The Prey&quot; (see p. 88) with a focus on Spirit Claimed.</li>
<li>Two new players joined the game: Ace playing <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and Blades playing <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>. Key is still with us playing <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>. Acting, who played <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a>, has been incommunicado and is assumed to have left the game due to lack of communication.</li>
<li>Wren and Clara don't know each other, but are traveling together in search of the Pack. Wren's smartphone rings and they're greeted by a small voice, an apparent spirit who bargains with them for Essence to tell them where to find the Pack. ^94f914</li>
<li>Clara receives a call from Alex, her brother, who's apparently been in the hospital and will be for about another week. He's been experiencing headaches and nightmares that involve Clara being hurt. He mentions something about their parents &quot;letting visitors in again.&quot; Wren also receives a brief call from Aiden, an on-again-off-again boyfriend.</li>
<li>The two encounter <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a>, the German shepherd that the Pack adopted on <a href="2021-06-27.html">2021-06-27</a>. Clara is able to speak with Germaine due to her Beast Talker Gift (see p. 137) and the dog leads the two to the manhole used by the Pack to pursue the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> and <a href="../Setting/Mooth Hirabayu.html">Mooth Hirabayu</a> on <a href="2021-08-15.html">2021-08-15</a>.</li>
<li>Upon sensing a stench of rat, Wren shifts into Urhan form and continues. They're spoken to by another spirit of some kind, one they're familiar with, and asked about dreams or visions they've been having. The spirit mentions something about ancestors murdering Wren's father.</li>
<li>Wren and Clara stumble upon the battle from <a href="2021-08-15.html">2021-08-15</a>: <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> in Gauru and Urshul forms respectively, garbage and a number of other things on fire, and the huge swarm of rats decorporated from the Beshilu. They enter the fray.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> has possessed <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>'s body, something that would normally be difficult but that the former seems able to do with ease in this case, and is attempting to have him engage in combat with the Beshilu.</li>
<li>While in the vicinity of the rat swarm, each member of the Pack takes a 2 dice penalty to rolls and 4 bashing damage per round. Dade takes 4 such bashing damage, then shouts at the rest of the Pack to run and does so himself out the way that he and Paca originally came in.</li>
<li>The Pack descends down the tunnel and back up the ladder. Dade spends 1 Essence (putting him at 7) and uses <a href="../System/Feet of Mist.html">Feet of Mist</a> to prevent himself from being tracked on the assumption that the Pack can evade the swarm. He also expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 3) to assist Paca and Wren in grappling Little Shadow to get him out of the sewers.</li>
<li>The Pack escapes the Beshilu. Dade and Wren both extend 1 Essence (putting him at 6) to shift to Hishu. Wren applies enough first aid to Little Shadow to keep him alive. Hanzer-gah Ninna is furious at the Pack for stopping him from having Little Shadow fight the Beshilu, but is unable to resist their efforts to get him to safety. The Pack uses Paca's car to return to HQ. Little Shadow slowly recovers.</li>
<li>Dade spends 1 Essence (putting him at 5) to use his Shadow Gaze ability from Crescent Moon's Gift to learn that Hanzer-gah Ninna's bane is mementos from the original Crescent Shadows pack. Dade recalls that he has personal Uratha-relevant belongings from his father that should be usable for this purpose. He takes Paca's car to retrieve them from his apartment while the rest of the Pack keeps Little Shadow immobilized.</li>
<li>Dade extends his remaining 3 Willpower to use the Banish rite and, with Paca's help, banishes Hanzer-gah Ninna, who declares war upon the Pack before vanishing into the Shadow. Dade and Little Shadow both collapse from exhaustion.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 3 Beats to celebrate the group playing again.</li>
<li>Dade takes 1 Beat for resolving the aspiration to survive the fight with the Beshilu, putting him at 10.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Next game is 11/7.</li>
