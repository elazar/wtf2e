<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> receives an unexpected visit from a stranger. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> discusses the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> with <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> and <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a> with <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> meets with <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> and accepts his offer. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> discovers she is being hunted and disappears.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> checks on their garden. They transition into presenting as male and shower in preparation for a date with <a href="../Setting/Mason.html">Mason</a>, who they haven't seen in sometime. There's a knock at the door, and <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> opens it, revealing a woman who is seemingly a member of <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>. The woman relates knowledge of the events at the Last Firstborn earlier in the evening and expresses the gratitude of <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> for their visit, but also confusion surrounding their reason for visiting and why they're &quot;upset&quot; with her, and claims to have sensed <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>'s presence in the process of passing by their location.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> invites the woman inside to attempt to answer their questions as they're able, and offers her food and drink. They mention the ability of Uratha to consume spirits, information which was previously unknown to <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, and ask the woman for more information about the organization, how they came to be, how they know about the Uratha, and so forth.</li>
<li>They also tell her of their <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Cahalith">Cahalith</a> auspice, their nature as a storyteller, the existence of First Tongue, the relevance of the phrase &quot;this story is true&quot; to their auspice, and brief descriptions of other auspices and of <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>'s own tribe. In doing so, they break the Oath of the Moon in the process, specifically that &quot;the Herd must not know;&quot; they gain 1 Harmony, placing them at 9 (see p. 96 and 104).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> describes the nature of Death Rage and the overall hesitation, if not avoidance, of Uratha to kill humans.</li>
<li>The woman in turn explains that they view Uratha as children of gods and privy to the Spirit. She mentions a normal human named Diana, who witnessed a battle between two Uratha, made subsequent claim of visions of Uratha, and began <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>. The goal of the organization was to come to know the Uratha, but given the information that <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> has provided, this might change. She takes her leave of <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> saying that the two should meet and talk at the earliest opportunity, then feeds <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> and <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a>. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> has been out of the Hisil for over a month now, putting him at Harmony 5. When <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> prompts him about it, he responds in English without realizing it, then hugs <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> in surprise. They discuss making a phone call to his parents that evening so he can speak to them, and maybe arranging for them to meet later in the week. They finish breakfast, then leave to take <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> for a walk and get ice cream.
<ul>
<li>As they walk, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> asks <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> about his knowledge and experiences of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. He recalls <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> as a rather boisterous, charismatic, and ambitious individual, and believes that his death may accelerate their attempt to gain complete control of Detroit.</li>
<li>The Pure tribes, with members such as <a href="../Setting/Julian Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>, have something to gain from their weakened state.</li>
<li>It might also affect <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>, despite his relatively independent status; <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> calls his secretary to schedule a visit with him later that evening.</li>
<li>Rumor has it that the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> suspects a human Hunter might've been responsible for LeShaun's death. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> also texts <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, suggesting that they meet that evening to discuss the possibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> complete their training when <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> manages to best <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> in a competition of wits, much to <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s bemusement.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> meet at HQ. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> admits that the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a> acted quickly and killed <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>, and didn't inform her until after the fact. The closest hospital to their HQ is the same one where <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> was taken.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> texts the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a>, attempting to provoke a response that might facilitate a meeting with them. They only respond that they aren't alright, suffered an attack at the base, and are recovering at the hospital. They reassure <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> that they'll be fine, caution her not to go on a vengeance spree, and agree to meet with her to talk once they've healed. She declines <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s offer to accompany him to see <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> in favor of retiring to her home to rest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> goes to the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a> and is escorted in to meet with <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>.
<ul>
<li>He has a fresh and apparently themed spread including raw meat, prey animals, and labeled flasks. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> is able to detect that at least some of the food and drink is laced with LSD or cocaine and avoid those while sampling something to appease him.</li>
<li>Upon him prompting her for her answer to his proposal regarding her working for him as his personal bodyguard, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> accepts, which seems to pleasantly surprise him.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> inquires about how his power to subdue Death Rage works, and asks if he knows of any human possesses the power to incite Death Rage, which he denies. She also asks him if he knows <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>, which prompts him to request a &quot;phone book&quot; and information on contacts from one of his lackeys.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> admits that the situation with <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> is what prompted her to seek him out. He says he'll look into it, then takes $500 out of a nearby drawer and hands it to her -- she notices his hands are very dry as he does so -- telling her to consider it a bonus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> pays a visit to <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>. After explaining the events of the previous night, Whistler tells <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> that he reminds him of his late son, Alek. He takes a bottle of stiff whiskey from a drawer and pours a pair of shots for the two of them. After he promises to come up with something to help broker peace and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> shuffles out of his office.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> heads home. On the way, she hears sirens and sees police cars. She senses <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and ducks into nearby bushes, shifting into Urhan form and attempting to eavesdrop as he speaks with officers.
<ul>
<li>The officer tells him that <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is a wanted person and recounts her quitting her job, purchasing a firearm, and becoming involved in gang violence.</li>
<li>Upon hearing this, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> slinks back through the bushes and makes a beeline for Pack HQ. She leaves a note there for the Pack asking them to take care of Miguel as she deals with some personal business, then disappears into the night.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gets 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gains 1 Beat for completing the long-term aspiration of helping <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> to break his bane and 1 Beat for investigating <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>'s murder, putting him at 64 Beats.</li>
