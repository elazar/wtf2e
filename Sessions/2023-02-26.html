<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>It's the last day of the half moon.</li>
<li>After departing <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>'s office, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> realizes there's a different, strong, and foreboding resonance in the Umbra, feelings of violence, torment, and a void that hungers.
<ul>
<li>Dade doubles back and explains the situation to <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>. The two travel to a nearby locus, an old scarred tree used in the past for hangings within a graveyard that's fallen out of use, in territory bridging Whistler's own with that of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. The two cross over to the Hisil. The tree there is twisted, black, and seemingly bleeding sap, unnerving even Whistler.</li>
<li>They begin traveling back toward <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>'s office as he explains that there is a wound in the Hisil. Bale Hounds, Uratha who are neither Pure nor Forsaken but can skillfully disguise themselves as either, delight in watching the world burn and in opening such wounds. Whistler suspects that they might be responsible. Whistler and his son Alek were pursuing one when Alek died.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> suggests that <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> consult with his pack about how to handle this situation, implying that this crisis may be an opportunity to cultivate goodwill with the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. The two part ways, Whistler moving back toward his office still in the Hisil while Dade doubles back to the hanging tree and returns to the Flesh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having parted ways with <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> and with the $500 bonus he provided,  <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> wades into the strong resonance of the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a> abounding around her. Using her heightened Uratha senses, she's able to locate two women willing to sell her a drug of her choice. After sufficient indulgence, she moves onto the dance floor and manages to impress and gather a crowd of equally influenced patrons.</li>
<li>Having returned to the Flesh, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts the pack, telling them there's an emergency and to meet him at HQ. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> arrives shortly after Dade; <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> takes a bit longer to orient herself and exit the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> meet her halfway and bring her back to HQ.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> finds the note left by <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, then has <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> call <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. Dade reassures him following his encounter with the police, and tells him he'll come to get him after the pack deals with their present situation. <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> appears. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> explains the situation and asks that she watch over <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, who isn't in the best of states to travel further.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> travel back to the graveyard to meet <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> and discuss the situation with him. He doesn't know any rituals to mend a wound in the Hisil, but promises to investigate.</li>
</ul>

<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> tagged <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> for beats in their absence.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes :
<ul>
<li>Star: I kind of like that <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s typical standbys, <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a>, aren't of immediate help in this situation. I'm curious how the Pack will resolve this.</li>
<li>Star: It was nice and very humanizing to see <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> cut loose a bit in the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>, after being largely focused on <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a> and attempting to quell her Uratha nature.</li>
<li>Star: Similar to how I enjoyed seeing more of <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a>'s character when he joined the Pack to fight <a href="../Setting/Su Ubh.html">Su Ubh</a>, I enjoyed seeing more of <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> when he related to <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> how his son Alek died and seeing the two of them bond.</li>
<li>Wish: The progression of events surrounding <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> and <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> has been a bit gradual and, at some points, a bit scattered. I'd like to see the pace around them pick up a bit.</li>
<li>Wish: An element of the game that's been interesting in the past, and that I think maybe we've gotten away from a little bit, has been seeing members of the Pack interact with their loved ones: <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a>, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, etc. I'd like to see more of that.</li>
</ul>
