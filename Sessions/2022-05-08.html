<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> goes to the gym, piques the interest of a potential beau, and has an ice cream date with <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> continues her search for Death Wolf by speaking with <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> and Longish Wish, then studies with <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and gives a message to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> for him. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> takes <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> to visit with his father and discovers when <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> will meet.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> goes to the SuperBad Boxing gym to work out. She gets noticed by one of the men working out there.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> goes to the library and finds <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a>. She expresses that <a href="../Setting/White Agora.html">White Agora</a> wasn't especially helpful in her locating Death Wolf. Learned Stray offers additional advice in exchange for a detailed report of how Clara goes about accomplishing her goal.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> travels to the Smokey Bottle Bar in the Shadow and witnesses someone doing noticeably well in a round of darts. Clara finds a spirit called Longish Wish that recognizes her as Uratha, who offers to facilitate her communication with Death Wolf in exchange for 2 Essence. Longish Wish admits to not knowing Death Wolf's location or how to contact him, only offering that Clara should hike through the Shadow in search of him. Clara rejects his proposal and laughs as he walks away.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> picks up <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> from <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> over the weekend. His current Harmony is 3. He has to spend one Essence to avoid shifting for one scene. Dade cautions him to avoid going into the Shadow, offers him burgers (processed food, see p. 104) to help his Harmony (bringing it to 4) so his ability to shift stabilizes, and opts to explain his limitation of speaking in First Tongue as a coping mechanism. Dade also informs him of the venue (the church used by <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> attempts to scope out the church, but it looks deserted. An old, beat-up black car appears with Jeremy. Dade confirms his identity, then goes and fetches <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> from a couple of blocks away. The two recognize each other and tears come to Jeremy's eyes. He expresses his regret for taking Little Shadow to the hospital that he ultimately escaped and his desire for him to return home. The two cry, reconcile, hug for several minutes, and eventually regain their composure. Jeremy asks what it will take for him to be able to come home. Dade suggests a gradual transition: more visits, seeing his mother and their home, allowing Dade to serve as his tutor, etc. The two part reluctantly, and Dade takes Little Shadow to hunt for partridges.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> returns to the area, finds the bank merchant spirit he previously saw at the docks, and gives him 1 Essence in exchange for information about <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>. The spirit tells him that meet weekly at midnight on Wednesday and mentions that faith spirits and Lunes alike comprise the congregation. They engage excitedly in prayer, seemingly to wolf gods (though not specific Uratha), howling, exuding Essence, and similar behaviors.</li>
<li>After school on Monday, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> offers to take <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> out for ice cream. He asks about <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and her condition; Paca reassures him that she'll be okay. Miguel invites <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> over for tutoring. The two talk about the events of the previous night when Miguel saw his mother shift (see <a href="2022-03-27.html">2022-03-27</a> and <a href="2022-04-10.html">2022-04-10</a>). Miguel's memories of the event seem hazy and he seems unsure how to proceed. Clara suggests that he pursue therapy; Miguel asks that Clara discuss it with Paca for him, and she agrees. He hugs her and passes her a couple of Hershey Kisses in thanks. Clara calls Paca and has a brief (if awkward) conversation to pass along the information.</li>
