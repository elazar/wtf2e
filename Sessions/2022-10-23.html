<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> arranges to meet with <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>. The battle between <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> culminates in death. The <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> reels from the events of the night and withdraws. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> succumbs to Death Rage and attacks <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a>, who descends into Lunacy and suffers a grievous wound.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Between <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> getting the kitten, who she's named Socks and who has bonded to her, and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> getting into it with <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> last session, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> contacts <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and obtains the contact information for the secretary of <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> from him. She contacts his secretary and books an appointment with him for 10:30 the next morning.</li>
<li>We established that <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a> would probably be staying with <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, either at <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s or <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s, on a semi-permanent basis.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> heals his previous 3 Lethal damage at the start of his turn. He expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 3) and attacks <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> with claws again (5 successes), putting her at 6 Lethal. (She would've healed the damage and Blindness tilt from <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s last attack at the start of her previous turn.)</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Cheryll.html">Cheryll</a> is staring with a glazed look in her eyes, seemingly only somewhat aware of what's happening around her. The rest of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> fares about the same. <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> looks extremely guilty, as though he's committed some unforgivable sin. Joy seems distraught and in disbelief. Tom doesn't seem to be faring any better. None of them are able to act this round.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> uses the Flanking merit (p. 108) to lower her Initiative and Defense.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 2) and attacks <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> again (2 successes), dealing 4 Lethal and upgrading 3 of her existing Lethal to Aggravated.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> roars in rage. <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> manages to pick up his gun, level it at <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a>, and fire (2 successes). <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> heals the residual Lethal damage from <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s attack and <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a>'s shot and attempts to attack him, but he ducks out of the way.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Cheryll.html">Cheryll</a> and the rest of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> attempt to enter the building, but can't because the Gauru forms of <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> make it impossible to do so. Joy and Tom remain unable to act.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> rushes <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> and attacks her with claws (7 successes, 9 Lethal damage), upgrading the rest of her health track with Lethal.</li>
<li>To avoid Death Rage, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 1 Essence (putting him at 8) and shifts into Urshul. He expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 1) and attacks <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> with his teeth, dealing 6 Lethal and upgrading her to 9 Aggravated.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> heals 3 Lethal and attacks <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a>, who she believes killed <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>, with her claws, ripping open his arm and knicking an artery. The rest of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> remains outside.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> attacks <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> with her claws and deals 4 Lethal, putting her at 10 Aggravated. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> follows suit with his teeth, finally causing her to collapse and shift into a mangled human corpse.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a>, still bleeding profusely and very much affected by Lunacy, uses his shaky hands to tear off a fragment of his shirt and wrap it around his wound to staunch the flow.</li>
<li>Outside, the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> feels their new alpha die. <a href="../Setting/Samuel Hanselman.html">Samuel Hanselman</a>, in a voice unlike him, chokes back rage as he vocally threatens whoever is responsible. Their Pack then withdraws from the area.</li>
<li>Before she succumbs to Death Rage, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> realizes that the nearby members of the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a> are liabilities and witnesses.</li>
<li>Through her link to the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> suddenly experiences a feeling of dread in relation to them. She tries texting the group chat, asking what's going on and where the others are, but no one responds. She then feels a presence and voice saying, &quot;Follow the trail of death and you will find what you seek.&quot; As quickly as it appeared, the presence is gone. She then attempts to speak with spirits, who in a panic direct her to <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a> HQ where the chaotic battle has taken place. She returns to the Flesh and follows their direction.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> uses her claws to make a down and dirty attack (p. 165) against <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> (3 successes). <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> fires his gun at <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and hits (1 success). <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> uses her jaws to rip his arm from his torso. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> manages to not succumb to Death Rage by proxy via <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> uses Pack Awareness to sense <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s imminent arrival. He expends 1 Essence (putting him at 7) to reflexively shift into Gauru form and roars at <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> in attempt to intimidate and distract her, but fails.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> attacks <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> again. He is in throes of Lunacy and blood loss, unable to defend himself or otherwise act.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> arrives on the scene and manages to avoid succumbing to Death Rage as well. She attempts to use her Auspice benefit of Darkess Into Light (p. 22) to quell <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s Death Rage, giving her the Stunned tilt. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s Rage recedes and she returns to her normal, if dazed, state of mind, but remembers nothing that occurred while she was in Death Rage. She reflexively downshifts into Hishu form, still tasting blood in her mouth as she sees <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> grievously wounded, but not yet dead. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> manage to avoid a Breaking Point (p. 104) for consumption of flesh and killing a fellow Uratha respectively.</li>

<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> wasn't able to make the game and tagged <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> for beats.</li>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for attendance and 1 for any aspirations in which they achieved progress.</li>
<li>Dade gains 1 Beat for #stars-and-wishes, putting him at 50 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes :
<ul>
<li>Star: The meeting of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>, <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a> at the latter's HQ certainly made for quite the climactic battle!</li>
<li>Star: I loved every scene with <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>: seeing her bond with Socks, sense that members of her Pack were in danger, rush to reach them, and use her powers to bring <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> out of the throes of Death Rage were all heartwarming.</li>
<li>Wish: <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s interactions with other characters, both Flesh and Spirit, have shown her to be very true to her <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Elodoth">Auspice</a>. At the same time, the gradual process of her discovering the nature of her Uratha existence has made for an interesting juxtaposition with the nature of her <a href="../System/Tribe.html#Bone Shadows">Tribe</a>. I look forward to seeing her develop even further as a character.</li>
<li>Wish: The deaths of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> and <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> could certainly lead to some interesting relations between the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a> and the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> moving forward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
