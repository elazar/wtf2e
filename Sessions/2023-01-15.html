<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> talk about <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and matters of safety. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> has a haunting vision and is cared for by the Pack before receiving a visit <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>, which <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> is informed of by <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> makes a decision and begins training with <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>. The threat of retribution from the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> looms.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> awakens from a restless sleep and calls <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. The two meet at home, share some hot chocolate, and talk briefly about the recent incident with <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> before <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> embraces <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and retires to her bedroom to sleep.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> awakens at HQ from a disturbing vision of abstract Uratha-related imagery with a general feeling of dread. They begin drawing what they can remember from their vision, though its reminiscent of a madman's scrawlings.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> calls <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, who awakens at this call, and asks her to meet at HQ. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> tells <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> that she must leave the house. To ensure his safety, she gives him her revolver and briefly shows him how to use it.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> makes her way on foot to HQ, with modestly successful parkour maneuvers to increase her speed.</li>
<li>Once the Pack has gathered, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> explain the incident that occurred earlier in the evening at The Last Firstborn. Given the seemingly dichotomic abilities of <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> and <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> also mentions her consideration of his offer to work for him, which <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> cautions against.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> scribbles intently and doesn't respond to prompts from the rest of the Pack. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> both examine her drawings and are able to deduce that they're related to <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s vision from earlier in the evening, which an implication that the relevant situation could spread outside their territory, even globally, if it's not stopped. It's decided that <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> will attempt to infiltrate <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>'s organization, with <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s help to function as an undercover agent.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> appears at HQ, having been on border patrol and with <a href="../Setting/Youthful Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a> on his shoulder. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> reports that the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> is likely to take some action, perhaps not that night but soon, against the Pack for the death of their alpha.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Youthful Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a> attempts to greet <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>, but <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> explain that <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> is in an odd mental state. <a href="../Setting/Youthful Curiosity.html">Youthful Curiosity</a> volunteers to investigate the situation by consulting with other spirits, then promptly vanishes.</li>
<li>Having run out of paper, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> begins laughing maniacally scribbling on random surfaces, includes <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s arm and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s hand (in the latter case writing &quot;the end&quot;). Upon hearing mention of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> suddenly regains focus, but then faints and collapses. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> kneels next to them, speaking in First Tongue and trying unsuccessfully to prompt them out of their mental haze.</li>
<li>As <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> tries to get <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> onto the couch, she attempts to make casual conversation with <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>. Once she's successful, she reminds <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> of their meeting the next morning, then departs HQ.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> confirms that <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> will look after <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>, then departs with <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. The three are eventually greeted by <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a>, who greets them excitedly and speaks animatedly with them as they journey toward <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s home. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> attempts to continue English lessons with <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, but is too tired from the night's events to make any inroads.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> eventually awakens with the Confused condition (p. 307). They find <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> standing nervously outside the warehouse with <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> baring fangs and bristling fur in her direction, referring to her as an abomination and ushering her out of HQ. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> attempts to reassure <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>, who continues to warn <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> against interactions with <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> and then begrudgingly withdraws. <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> offers to help <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> sleep, which they accept, adding the Steadfast condition (p. 311) for four days. She then nudges <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> in the direction of the couch inside of HQ, encouraging them to look after themselves before waving goodbye and leaving.</li>
<li>In the morning, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> uses her school access to get <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s address, goes to her apartment, and calls her cell phone to wake her and be let in. She then proceeds to train <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> in how to be cautious in dealing with others, glean information about them and evaluate their veracity, lie convincingly, etc.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> wakes to someone speaking his name and a wet nose being pushed against his cheek. After a moment, he recognizes the voice as speaking First Tongue, referring to him as &quot;Ithaeur,&quot; and opens his eyes to find <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>, who reports the incident with <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> to him and reminds him that loons are the selected prey of <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Ithaeur">Ithaeur</a> and <a href="../System/Tribe.html#Bone Shadows">Bone Shadows</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> thanks <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> for bringing the matter to his attention and promises to speak with <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and to look into ways to protect HQ from loons when <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> is not present.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> is able to sleep through the night and awakens with the Confused condition resolved.</li>
