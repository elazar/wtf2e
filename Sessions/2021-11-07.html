<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> peer across the Gauntlet and are haunted by visions of the return of <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> is visited by <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>, checks in with <a href="../Setting/Samuel%20Hanselman.html">Samuel Hanselman</a>, and encounters <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and Clara hold vigil over a recovering <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. Clara takes Germaine to get food for the pack and visits her brother Alex in the hospital. Dade calls <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and meets with <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> to investigate <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Pack retreats to HQ. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> uses spirit senses (p. 94-95) to reach across the Gauntlet. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 1 Essence (putting him at 6) to do the same from a state of minimal consciousness. Both hear voices chattering back and forth about the exorcism of <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> and his possible return and annihilation of the Pack and the spirits who bore witness to the exorcism.</li>
<li>While peering across the Gauntlet, Clara sees the Pack locus and visions of violence and fear from its origins. She also sees a change in <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>: claw marks on his body not colored silver like his runes and a glowing red First Tongue glyph symbolizing fire inscribed on his back.</li>
<li>As Clara withdraws from the Gauntlet, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> steps outside and is greeted by a woman named <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>, with whom they are apparently acquainted. The two of them walk and chat briefly as Wren recounts their eventful evening with the Pack.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> offers to &quot;use power&quot; to help Wren &quot;feel better.&quot; She has them sit down and does something to cause their dopamine levels to skyrocket them into a euphoric and blissful state, gaining the Stunned Tilt and Swooning Condition toward Rebecca in the process. She encourages Wren to enjoy himself and not concern himself so much with the Pack. As Wren steps out of the shadows, where Rebecca remains, she waves them off and jokingly tells them to &quot;be back by midnight.&quot;</li>
<li>Wren returns to their apartment to shower and change. They find it untouched save for a note on the door that says, &quot;Hope you're doing alright. Please let us know how you are. We need you.&quot; Wren removes it from the door and heads inside.</li>
<li>Wren sends a text to let one of &quot;them,&quot; Samuel, letting know they're alright, and expresses uncertainty about their future relations with Pack. They recall that they didn't ask the Pack's name. Samuel expresses concern that the Pack could've been Pure and refers to the <a href="../Setting/Crescent%20Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a> as the &quot;newcomers.&quot;</li>
<li>Samuel also warns Wren to &quot;come back,&quot; that &quot;your thing could get us all killed,&quot; and that LeShaun (presumably <a href="../Setting/LeShaun%20White.html">LeShaun White</a>) wants to speak with them. Wren also recounts the possession of Little Shadow by Hanzer-gah Ninna and the latter's declaration of war on the Pack. Samuel is apparently an Ithaeur and inquires about Wren's recent dreams. Wren says he'll likely visit Samuel soon, possibly the next day.</li>
<li>Clara is left alone inside with Little Shadow and Dade, both of whom are conscious but also exhausted and healing. She calls to <a href="../Setting/Germaine.html">Germaine</a>, who does eventually appear. Unfortunately, the warehouse contains nothing in the way of toys or food. Germaine indicates he's hungry, so Clara drives Germaine to a nearby Burger King to feed him and the rest of the Pack.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> returns to HQ and comforts Little Shadow as he heals. Clara feeds him and he becomes a bit more solid and returns to Harmony 3.</li>
<li>Paca returns home, sneaks in to find Miguel asleep, puts her clothes on to launder, showers, and goes to sleep. Dade remains asleep on a couch at the warehouse.</li>
<li>Clara returns to the hospital to visit with her brother Alex. She tells him about meeting the Pack, Germaine in particular. She describes them as &quot;strange, but not in a bad way.&quot; Alex asks teasingly if &quot;there are any cute ones,&quot; to which Clara says no. Clara asks Alex if he's had dreams, and he says no, that he's been afraid to sleep. He also mentions that when he does dream, they tend to go back to Clara. He expresses that she's important, that she can't let what's happening with him affect her, and that she needs to live her life and be happy.</li>
<li>Dade calls <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and is able to reach him. He asks about <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> and his connection to <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. Whistler says that Graves is quite powerful and Fire-Touched. The two of them apparently used to both be members of the Cruelswipe Hounds.</li>
<li>Whistler isn't familiar with Little Shadow or that Michael Stantz was alpha of the Crescent Shadows. Whistler does know that <a href="../Setting/Muthgah%20Ninna.html">Muthgah Ninna</a> was apparently their totem, and had heard of her transformation into <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, which apparently caused the latter to become a Magath. He had not heard that Dade was the one who had banished him, nor that Hanzer-gah Ninna had declared war on the Pack. Whistler suggests training, putting wards around HQ, vigilantly patrolling the Shadow, and bargaining with spirits to assist in protecting them.</li>
<li>Wren visits with Samuel, who chastises him for wandering off and worrying the rest of them, and inquires about him wandering into Crescent Shadows territory. Wren is apparently one of the better Dreamers in the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. They discuss the encounter with the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> and Hanzer-gah Ninna.</li>
<li>Wren goes to the Smokey Bottle Bar, where they make small talk with someone who turns out to be Miguel, Paca's son. The two move on to flirting with each other, then decide to move to a nearby park. They continue conversing about school, constellations, and other similar mundane topics. Wren enjoys the time away from the chaos of being Uratha. Eventually, the two share a brief kiss. Miguel invites Wren to return to his home, which so far as he he knows is empty; Wren stays overnight with him.</li>
<li>Dade meets with <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a>.
<ul>
<li>Dade inquires about the spirit he encountered on <a href="2021-08-01.html">2021-08-01</a>. He's heard of mockingjay and mockingbird spirits who can imitate voices, but not paralyze people. He suggests researching more about the spirit at the library and says that, so long as a person respects the library, they shouldn't see any trouble from <a href="../Setting/Wise%20Lost.html">Wise Lost</a>. Dade would have to present himself before he'd be allowed in.</li>
<li>He's also familiar with Little Shadow: he experienced his First Change in an insane asylum. Michael and the Crescent Shadows apparently broke him out of there before burning it down. Little Shadow then swore his allegiance to Black Wolf and the pack totem.</li>
<li>Selby recommends executing a hunt for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> soon.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> has unsuccessfully tried to recruit Selby in the past. Selby suspects that Graves may have power in communicating with spirits, and may be interested in Little Shadow to learn how to survive what killed off the previous Crescent Shadows. Graves came on the scene not long before the Crescent Shadows disappeared. The two had no known dealings or connection to each other.</li>

<ul>
<li>Thunder needed to consult the Gauntlet Strength chart, which is on p. 101.</li>
<li>The background music for the start of game was from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJODqu-ftnA">Dark City</a>.</li>
<li>Wren listens to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yco-B4BSaj4">&quot;Good Riddance&quot; from Hades</a>.</li>
<li>Completed the short-term aspiration: Investigate Julian Graves.</li>
