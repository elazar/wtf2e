<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The Pack investigates <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>, discovers a mysterious robed woman, has its first experience with Basu-Im, and gains Renown.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Julian Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> refers to <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> as a &quot;son of the harlot,&quot; and berates <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> for associating with him. He seems to have knowledge of the fate of the Crescent Shadows, Little Shadow's former pack, and remarks that the Pack must have made an impression to have Little Shadow choose to join them. He seems rather disgusted by the Pack receiving their current territory, and anticipates their activities in the Shadow will earn them many enemies.</li>
<li>Because of his Harmony level, <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> can presently speak only in First Tongue. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> continue looking for loci. They find a tree used for hanging a long time ago, which has a dark resonance, and a fire hydrant that makes Little Shadow smile and wax nostalgic about children playing in its waters.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> fills <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> in on spirit courts, gatherings of spirits who rule over the spirit realm and are based on a central theme. The two local courts in Detroit and Highland are of Hope and Fatalism. It's generally a good idea to get on the good side of one of the courts, as the spirits that rule them have significant influence.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> also tells <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> a little about his father, that he had a bit of an ego and was a perfectionist. He may have foreseen his own death, but never talked about it. He also talks a bit about the manhole he doesn't want to revisit, and a <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> that's down there, and may have been responsible for the death of his pack, but he's not sure. The host constituents look like normal creatures, but are hyper-intelligent, and even a single one can ensure the host's survival. They vehemently hate Uratha. He warns Dade to be prepared to deal with swarms of these creatures if the pack goes down into the manhole, and confides in Dade that his previous experience down there left him with a phobia of rats.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> does some cursory research on <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> and finds that he's a charismatic actor of some repute, has a lot of followers on social media (especially in the way of videos), and patronizes the Smokey Bottle Bar, a particular college bar in town. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> finds that he has enjoyed a sudden recent rise in popularity within the last year.</li>
<li>It's now a new moon. <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> seems elated, as this is apparently the most comfortable phase for a fox spirit.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> lies to Miguel and tells him that she's going to bridge night with her girlfriends, when she's really going to check out the Smokey Bottle Bar with the Pack. Miguel assumes she's off to see her boyfriend that doesn't actually exist. <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> brings his friend Alyssa, as she's the one who invited him. She wears a dress, has a very chipper manner, and greets each member of the Pack with a firm handshake. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> leaves <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> at his apartment with chicken nuggets for dinner and <a href="../Setting/Muthgah Ninna.html">Muthgah Ninna</a> to watch over him.</li>
<li>After some time, the Pack notices that a stray conversation about <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> inside the bar seems to have continued on for two hours. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and the bartender have a brief exchange about him; the bartender seems to recall that he's from out of down, Cleveland maybe.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> arrives and the Pack find themselves distracted (failed a Wits + Resolve + Primal Urge roll, -2 to all dice pools for the scene), but sense a resonance of desire for his liking from everyone. Aside from one girl who's an obvious admirer, who he rebuffs, and who excuses herself, everyone else in the bar remains hanging on Alex's every word for two hours following his arrival.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> goes outside the bar to check on the girl, who has remained in her car. On her way back, a mysterious robed woman wearing a white robe with an emblem on the back approaches Paca with a beaming smile and causes her to spontaneously go into Wasu-Im. The woman responds to Paca's sudden shift of form by singing something reminiscent of a hymn with an expression of pure rapture and worship on her face. The girl in the car sees Paca shift and is terrified. The commotion draws the attention of the bar, negating their -2 penalty.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> make their way outside, also go into Wasu-Im, shift into Urshul form, and book it for the nearest edge of their Highland Park territory. Within minutes, they reach their headquarters, and <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> retreats into the Shadow upon seeing their state. Dade shifts into Garou form and succumbs to Basu-Im for 10 minutes (due to Harmony 7). Elric uses an ability to force Dade out of Basu-Im and back into Urshul form, stunning him. The two manage to make it to a nearby string of abandoned shacks before the rage takes them. They awaken to find the shacks with large holes in them, but no other visible damage to person or property.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> manages to break into the girl's car, get hold of her neck, and snap it, killing one of the two witnesses to her shift. Paca then turns to the singing dancing mysterious robed woman and falls into Basu-Im. When she awakens, she finds that she's taken bites of the girl (and against all odds lost no Harmony in the process) and solidly smashed up the car. Police are taking statements about the girl's disappearance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> receives a call from Alyssa, but lets it go to voicemail. He then receives a call from <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, picks up, and instructs her to meet them at &quot;home&quot; (headquarters).</li>
<li>They all see lunes, white spirits of Luna, descend upon headquarters from the sky and Shadow, in particular a representative of each of the full moon, gibbous moon, and crescent moon. One of them says, &quot;The Mother has noticed. You have increased in her eyes.&quot;</li>
<li>The Pack gains eligibility for a dot of Wisdom Renown increase in the form of a tattoo-like brand that tells the story of how they looked for the nonviolent solution when dealing with <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gains eligibility for another dot of Wisdom Renown increase for his part in making the agreement with <a href="../Setting/Muthgah Ninna.html">Muthgah Ninna</a>. <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> also gains eligibility for one dot of Glory Renown for how he handled his Basu-Im. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> also gains eligibility for one dot of Purity Renown for killing the witness to his Uratha identity.</li>
