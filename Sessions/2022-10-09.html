<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> saves a kitten. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> pays a visit to <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> at the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a> and receives a cryptic text from <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a>. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> deals with their emotional aftermath from <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>'s death with <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> engages a raging <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> in combat; <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> joins the fray.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>It's been five days since the conversation between <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>.</li>
<li>Following her departure from the scene of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>'s murder, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> speaks with a black kitten with white paws, coaxes it to her home, makes formula, and feeds it. She returns to the place where she found the kitten to attempt to find its mother, but is unsuccessful.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> sends a group text to the Pack asking about their leads on <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> replies that he's a Host. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> replies that he can keep Uratha from Death Rage, and that he has bodyguards of that nature in his employ.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> watches as the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> calms and participates in a ritual to lift up the corpse of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> to move it for burial, and tails them at a respectable distance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> approaches the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>, but hears a voice saying in First Tongue, &quot;I wouldn't go any further if I were you, sister.&quot; She shifts into Hishu form for the sake of having an open conversation, but is opposed by the hired guard at the entrance she happens to approach and saunters off. She withdraws to the front entrance and manages to be escorted inside.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> returns to <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a> HQ and is eventually joined by <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>. They remuninate on being cast out of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>, feeling some relief at being out from under the thumb of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> and <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a>, and having a chance to breathe and take refuge from thoughts of past and future in the present. <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> departs, leaving <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> to their thoughts.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> asking for contact information for <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> provides it, but cautions <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> to be careful in her dealings with him. She attempts to contact him, but is rebuffed and referred to his secretary.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is invited to sample from the table of <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>'s table, and pours a seemingly transparent wine of sorts in a fancy glass. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> alludes to connections with the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a> and the recent murder of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>, and attempts to use them as a bargaining chip. Ultimately, <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> rebuffs her, but offers her free admission to the club as a consolation prize of sorts, and she is able to learn that he has contacts among the black market. Just before she leaves, she receives a text from from <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> saying, &quot;Stay away. They found us.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> tails the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> as they approach a small building and bang on the door. <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a> shifts into Gauru and plunges through the wall. Yelling, screaming, and gunfire follow. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> shifts to Urshul and pursues her, crashing through a window, shifting to Gauru, and swiping at her arm and shoulder with claws, dealing 8 Lethal damage. She voluntarily submits to Death Rage.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> shifts to Urhan and tries to find the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a> HQ, but has only ever been guided there blindfolded.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> uses claws and manages to blind the left eye of <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a>. He expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 4), but fails to deflect her attack and takes 3 Lethal damage. He manages to soak 1 Lethal damage from her subsequent attack.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> finds <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, shifts into Gauru, and slashes at <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a>, but she soaks it.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> takes 1 Beat toward investigating the murder of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> insofar as pursuing <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s suspected culprit. That and #stars-and-wishes put him at 48 Beats.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> takes 1 Beat toward joining the <a href="../Setting/Crescent Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a> for not joining in the <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Star: Seeing <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> visit and attempt to negotiate with <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> was certainly interesting. He seems fairly unconcerned with recent events in the city. Makes me wonder if he's tuned into a wavelength that we aren't.</li>
<li>Star: <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s tailing of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> erupting into an all-out fight between him, <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> was certainly an interesting turn of events! I look forward to seeing how the battle ends.</li>
<li>Wish: <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> is the only player character who hasn't met <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> yet. Not sure if that should change, or how to bring it about in an intelligible way, but it could make for an interesting conversation.</li>
<li>Wish: <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> both seemed to be more in the background this session dealing with their own individual events or goals. I'd like to see a compelling reason for them to be more in the thick of pack activity.</li>
