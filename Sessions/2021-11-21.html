<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The Pack goes to the library, meets <a href="../Setting/Wise%20Lost.html">Wise Lost</a>, and learns about the spirits plaguing them. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> encounter a spirit called <a href="../Setting/Walker%20Breaker.html">Walker Breaker</a>, which takes over Paca's car and attempts to kill them all.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> asks a favor of the Pack. There's a spirit taking control of vehicles -- a &quot;car spirit&quot; -- and using them to kill people. It seems to take a delight in doing so, which is abnormal for that type of spirit. It has declared Paca to be their enemy, and calls itself &quot;Walker Breaker.&quot;</li>
<li>Dade tells the pack about his encounter with the spirit at his apartment. He brings up that <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> suggested the library, which is within the Pack's territory, as a place to investigate spirits.</li>
<li>The Pack enters the library in the Spirit, feeling the weight of knowledge, the price of banishing ignorance, and monotony and routine on them. Paca purchases a new book beforehand, &quot;Kingdom of the Cursed,&quot; to donate to the library as an offering to <a href="../Setting/Wise%20Lost.html">Wise Lost</a>, who considers itself in charge of the place.</li>
<li>A Magath calling itself &quot;Wise Lost&quot; approaches the Pack, appearing to be a Frankensteinish anthropomorphic mix of purebreed felines wearing strips of scrolls, VHS tape, and other symbols of knowledge. The Pack requests Wise Lost's wisdom and guidance in the matter of Walker Breaker and the spirit that visited Dade. It accepts Paca's offering of the book and seems to absorb the Essence of the book's own spirit into those of the library. It gives the Pack free reign of the library for the night, suggests looking in the News and Myth sections, and wanders off.</li>
<li>Due to lack of a Locus, the Pack must remain in the Shadow. Dade and Clara visit the Myths section while Paca checks out the News section. While there, Clara also researches how to reverse a Change.</li>
<li>Paca finds reports of a massive dumptruck, nicknamed the &quot;Killer Truck,&quot; that caused multiple accidents over the past year and, after a failed attempt at escape to a nearby freeway, was dumped into a junkyard.</li>
<li>Dade finds reports of a disappearance that sound somewhat similar to his experience with his own spirit:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Police are still searching for Roweena Atkinson, the 19-year-old LSU sophomore missing since last Friday. According to Atkinson's friend, Jill Hunter, the last person to speak to Atkinson before her disappearance, Atkinson claimed to have heard a baby crying outside her apartment door.
She said she was going to go see if she could find the baby,&quot; Hunter said. &quot;I heard her open the door, and then she screamed. I think she must have dropped the phone when he grabbed her, because I thought I heard birds singing for a minute before the line went dead.&quot;
When police arrived six minutes later, they found the apartment door ajar, with no sign of a struggle. No cell phone was found at the scene, leading police to suspect the kidnapper took it with him. When asked about a popular Internet rumor that a serial killer is operating in and around the Baton Rouge area, luring single women out of their apartments with an audio recording of a crying infant, police spokesman Jean DuBois had this to say:&quot;We have no evidence of any sort of audio recording being used in the perpetration of this or any other abduction in Baton Rouge at this time. This rumor is just that: someone inventing a plausible explanation for this tragic, senseless crime. Nevertheless, we urge all citizens, especially those living by themselves, to be cautious when opening their doors after dark. If, for any reason, you feel suspicious of someone or something outside your home at night, call the police and stay indoors.&quot;
Police are questioning Atkinson's boyfriend, 21-year-old LSU junior lan McClane as part of their investigation. Readers who believe they know the whereabouts of Roweena Atkinson are encouraged to call the Baton Rouge Police Department's tip hotline at...</p>

<ul>
<li>Dade also finds a myth that seems like it may be relevant, taken from &quot;A Collection of the Folktales and Legends of the Norwegians&quot; by Olaf Sigmundson, 1985 translation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there exists, in that part of the country, a curious tale of a goblin or spook they call the &quot;Magpie Man.&quot; According to the legend, this creature perches on a window ledge at night, and calls out in a voice like unto that of a babe in distress. When the goodwife of the house opens the shutters, this goblin spirits her away to the land of the trolls, where she is made to keep the creature's house for it until she dies. It is said that the only way to escape this fate is to harden one's heart against the piteous wailing and to spend the night in prayer to St. Simon of Trent, the patron of children and the victims of kidnapping. If a person can ignore the devil child and pray until dawn, the goblin will be tricked into staying out all night and will be turned into a tree by sunrise.
Why such a cautionary tale, which runs so counter to the parables of Christ, should have come about in this region, I do not know. The clders of the town tell of a famine many years ago: perhaps the tale came out of a harsher time, when an abandoned babe meant another mouth to feed for his saviors, and it was deemed kinder to let the child die swiftly of exposure. Today the tale is told by women to frighten their children into behaving -- &quot;Be good, or the Magpie Man will get you!&quot; -- and yet during my time in the village. I noticed that whenever a babe wailed within earshot, my hosts would cross themselves and murmur a prayer to St. Simon.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Pack goes to a nearby junkyard and finds that the famed &quot;Killer Truck&quot; is indeed housed there. Paca inspects the truck and, since she can't afford to purchase the entire truck, instead purchases the tires to ensure that the truck can't easily be made to run again.</li>
<li>As Paca begins to drive back into town from disposing of the tire, the car's wheel seems to be taken over. Doors refuse to open, windows lock, and the wheel keeps rolling back toward the tire bonfire.</li>
<li>Dade and Clara each spend 1 Essence (putting him at 5) to shift into Urshul and manage to break the back window open. Paca shifts into Dalu and breaks out the front window. Each of them spend 1 Essence (putting Dade at 4) to shift into Urhan, then leap out of the car before it hits the bonfire. The car then turns on Paca and hits her for 3 lethal damage.</li>
<li>Dade spends 1 Essence (putting him at 3) and uses Shadow Gaze to determine that the spirit's bans are that it must grieviously harm someone at least once a month and that it cannot be easily deterred from combat in an area with people who are not in buildings or vehicles. Its bane are tools from mechanics who have previously worked on the truck.</li>
<li>The Pack makes a break for a nearby thicket. The car hits Clara for 8 lethal damage (out of 7 health, upgrading 1 to aggravated) and knocks her down. Paca jumps on top of the car and shifts into Gauru form. Dade spends 1 Essence (putting him at 2), scoops up Clara (who shortly after falls unconscious), and chases after Paca and the car.</li>
<li>Paca lands two massive claw marks into the car, but to little effect. Walker Breaker takes 2 Essence from Paca into itself. Paca falls into Basu-Im and heals all lethal previously taken, remaining steadfast into taking down Walker Breaker and calling after Dade in First Tongue to run. Dade shifts into Dalu form and attempts to flee to safety with Clara.</li>

<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 1 Beat for 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>Everyone in the Pack who helped to recap the session gains 1 Beat, putting Dade at 16.</li>

<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Our randomly assigned name on <a href="https://www.watchparty.me">WatchParty</a> was &quot;glossy-angle-stroke.&quot; I commented that it sounded like a J. J. Abrams porn flick.</li>
<li>Ace brought up a movie called &quot;Rubber&quot; about a killer tire at a rather amusing (quoth Key) &quot;King of the Hil&quot; moment when the Pack disposes of the Killer Truck tires.</li>
