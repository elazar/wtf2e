<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Tried <a href="https://w2g.tv">Watch2Gether</a>, but Thunder had issues with it randomly stopping.</li>
<li>Background music is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgQwst5OFmA">Kai Engel - Brume</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> rolls Resolve + Composure for violating the Oath of the Moon by revealing her Uratha nature to <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and succeeds, preventing a Harmony change. After Paca shifts to Dalu, Miguel stumbles back, instantly terrified, begins to suffer the effects of Lunacy, and gains the Shaken Condition (p. 310). He bolts for the door and slips through Paca's grasp. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> goes after him and tries to calm him down, but after stopping briefly, he sprints out of the house.</li>
<li>Background music changes to <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FQ0CS1XW-y0">Awkward Meeting by Kevin McLeod</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> shifts into Urhan and pursues <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> into an alleyway, then shifts back to Hishu. Miguel seems wary and afraid, but also fascinated. Paca tries to coax him home, but Miguel insists that she explain herself before he'll leave with her. She attempts to do so, but Miguel is still skeptical.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> manages to follow the two of them and comes around the corner of the alleyway, startling Miguel. He asks what happened to them and they do their best to explain and corroborate Paca's story, but Miguel only appears more confused.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> manages to redirect <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s focus with a bit of cunning, making him believe that the whole ordeal stemmed from her feelings about him going away to college. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> calls her briefly just then, as he sensed her shifting, but she reassures him that everything is fine. She and <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> manage to coax Miguel out of the alleyway. He plees with the two of them to let him take a walk for an hour, and Paca lets him go before crying into Wren's shoulder in Spanish.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> returns home, pours a glass of wine, and calls <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> back and explains what's happened. Dade points out that very bad things could come from <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> mentioning any of what he's seen to the wrong person; he asks that she let him know if Miguel returns. Paca then texts the Hunter cell, provides a photo of Miguel, and explains that he's left home and asks that they return him if they find him.</li>
<li>Back at her apartment, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> grapples with her lacking memory of what happened while she was in Basu-Im and hoping she didn't cause any harm. Her spirit touchstone, an old patchy wolf spirit, senses her pain and appears to her; he talks with her about the previous night's events and attempts to comfort her. He reminds her how she sought him out when she was younger and how they bonded in those times. He also brings her a message from her patron, Death Wolf: &quot;I've felt your pain and I'm willing to discuss what you're feeling and help you arrive at an answer.&quot; However, to do so, Clara would have to find her in the Shadow and go to her. He urges her to start by consulting the spirits and wishes her luck.</li>
<li>The next day, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> contacts <a href="../Setting/Samuel%20Hanselman.html">Samuel Hanselman</a> and asks him for information on crafting fetishes. After he prods, Wren confirms that they have lost both eyes, and informs him of their plan to replace their eyes with fetishes. He offers to craft them himself, but Wren insists they also want to learn how to do it themselves. He tells them to meet with him later that night to hunt for the fetish ingredients.</li>
<li>Back at her home, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> stirs from sleep and harriedly searches to see if <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> has returned. She finds him in his bedroom, staring forward and looking confused but unaware of Paca's presence. She finds no influencing spirits in the area and prompts Miguel for his attention. He doesn't respond for about half a minute, but then startles and comes to. He describes having just found himself in a vast plane of white emptiness; Paca can only assume that what he experienced was a hallucination caused by either a spirit or drugs. Miguel seems concerned about his experience, but reassures Paca that it wasn't due to drugs. Paca reassures him, then tells him to come with her to make waffles for breakfast, which seems to cheer him up.</li>
<li>Having sent <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> to stay with <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> (who accommodates him in a doggy bed in her room so long as he's not in Hishu form), <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> is alone recovering in his apartment. He searches the internet for more information on the Magpie Man.
<ul>
<li>He finds a particular story about a man who heard his old ex calling to him from outside of his house at night, odd both because they were broken up and because it wasn't like her to be out at night. After half an hour, he heard her walk away, but in the morning, he saw no footprints on the deep winter ground. Laid on his doorstep, he found one large, long black feather.</li>
<li>Newspapers reporting the story refer to a &quot;Jilted Lover&quot; or &quot;Jilted Ex,&quot; but also mention native American tales of Magpie Men who would drag women off, referring to such voices as &quot;The Poacher,&quot; &quot;The Copycat Caller,&quot; and &quot;The Crybaby Caller.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> consults academic occult sources available to him for more information. (Thunder appears to have lost her notes on this. We'll put a pin in it and come back to it later.)</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> calls <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>'s father. Turns out he knows about <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>: they took over a warehouse he worked in after it shut down before moving to a church on the outskirts of town. Dade introduces himself by his first name only; Jeremy and Suzanna are his parents, and Jeremy introduces them in kind. Lee is Little Shadow's birth name. Dade agrees to meet with them at the church that Lupus et Fidelis is currently using for their meetings (apparently only once weekly) in a couple of weeks once he's had a chance to heal from his wounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> treks out to a local graveyard in search of Death Wolf. She finds a spirit of a human mourner dressed in black, sitting and basking in the resonance of grief. Upon closer examination, she finds that the spirit has deep, black pits in place of eyes and is hollow. Clara greets the spirit and mentions her search for Death Wolf. The spirit offers to give her related information in exchange for a personal story of sadness. Clara confesses to having been reminded earlier that day that she had her hurt brother <a href="../Setting/Alex.html">Alex</a>. The spirit refers her to Long Wishing, a desire spirit, for more information to further her mission. The spirit directs her to find Long Wishing in a place where people desire something strongly without knowing if they'll get it: the Smokey Bottle Bar.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> has spent one day recovering from his wounds at this point, removing half of one Aggravated damage.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for recap, 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> takes 1 Beat for taking a step in the aspiration of reuniting <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> with his parents and 1 Beat for taking a step in discovering the identity of the Magpie Man, putting him at 55 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Thunder described something called &quot;stars and wishes:&quot; 2 things each player liked about a session and 2 things they want to see happen respectively. We should post them to the #stars-and-wishes channel.</li>
