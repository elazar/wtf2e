<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The Pack discovers the <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> cult and seeks help to curtail them. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> takes <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> to meet Miguel.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Each member of the Pack awakens to a news report about <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s victim, and suspect an imposed curfew may be a possibility. The victim was <a href="../Setting/Gloria Stanze.html">Gloria Stanze</a>, 21, a local biology major. The Police have gone through the wreckage of the car. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s claw marks were found in the asphalt, which the local news is puzzling over.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> recounts the events of the night to <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, which apparently resulted in the release of a new spirit group that includes one or more cannibal spirits. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> recalls that the woman's white robe was hand-made and decorated with wolf-themed images. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> suggests that he scour the Shadow while <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> contacts his mentor, <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a>, and sets up a meet at an abandoned opera house on Jefferson Street to try to find out more about the woman.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> wakes at Alyssa's and texts the rest of the Pack; everyone checks in. Alyssa brings Elric coffee, then ducks out to go shopping. Shortly after, he hears a knock at the door: it's <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a>, a dark-eyed black-haired woman who Elric recognizes as one of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a>'s lackeys and a member of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. She suggests that he consult with <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and gives Elric his card. He owns a business, Whistler and Peck, in the downtown district, that handles parks, development, and recreation. He's a Uratha and a known fixer for packs in these sorts of situations.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> wants $50, dinner from McD's, an update on what we find, and a promise to get the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> to stop hounding him to join them. <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, &quot;The Wolf and the Faithful,&quot; a not-so-secretive church / cult that believes werewolves exist and worship them as a supernatural force. They are normal humans who can sense and track werewolves without spiritual aid. They have resistance to lunacy and can spontaneously instigate Wasu-Im. Sister Cathwulf leads their local branch from an old shack on a bad edge of town in the pack's territory. Selby suggests using spiritual and human forces to infiltrate and drive the cult out of the area. He believes lunes may be protecting them.</li>
<li>Each Pack member receives 1 Willpower for sleeping and for spending time with their touchstones. They meet at headquarters to exchange information, but <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> isn't there. The new moon is edging into a crescent moon. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> enters through a locus and informs them that there are at least two cannibal spirits, and that the bane of one is dish soap.</li>
<li>At his behest, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> brings <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> back to her home to play with her son Miguel. <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> contacts <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and arranges a meet with him for 9:00 that evening. He and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> have lunch at a cafe and, at a nearby construction site, see a few men gathered around a large Urshul-sized hole in a chain link fence with nearby claw tracks. The wind carries a confusing and unfamiliar scent that seems distracting, unnatural, and just off, noticeable to humans but not as offensive as to werewolves.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>'s building is fairly large. A number of his employees appear to be Uratha or wolf-blooded. <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> are led to his office. He allows them to sniff him to confirm that he's Uratha and a Pure, though seemingly also a centrist. He agrees to assist with infiltrating <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>. He's unfortunately not on good terms with <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> either and is unable to smooth things over with the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a>. He'll contact them via e-mail in a few nights with an update.</li>
<li>The Pack will try to consult with the spirit court of Hope next session to see if they'll assist.</li>
