<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> goes on the hunt with the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> for <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> pursue Su Ubh into the Shadow to rescue <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and find <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> travels to <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> HQ after having prepared for a hunt. <a href="../Setting/LeShaun%20White.html">LeShaun White</a> has heard that a member of the <a href="../Setting/Ivory%20Claws.html">Ivory Claws</a> was having a &quot;stag party&quot; or something along those lines, and wants his Pack to crash it.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> has a Blood Talon ability to see the Renown of other Uratha during the Siskur Dah without them intentionally flashing them, in silver for Forsaken and flaming red for Pure.</li>
<li>The <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> has a lion spirit as their totem.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> rolls Perception (Composure + Wits) + Primal Urge (2 successes) and notices that spirits nearby are in too ordered a configuration and giving off a substantial amount of pain. <a href="../Setting/LeShaun%20White.html">LeShaun White</a> dismisses it as normal given the involvement of the <a href="../Setting/Ivory%20Claws.html">Ivory Claws</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> shifts instantly into Urhan form and project their senses (2 successes) across the Gauntlet.
<ul>
<li>They see a large golden retriever and hear an elderly-sounding man wishing congratulations to a man named Gregory (presumably Gregory Whistler). Gregory responds by thanking the other man, calling him Julian (presumably Julian Graves), and expresses that he will miss hunting, but now has a business to run.</li>
<li>Julian asks if Gregory will return, expressing concern that he will lose touch with his wolf side. Gregory flatly denies this and dismisses the concerns, saying that he takes a sabbatical from his work at least once a month.</li>
<li>Julian asks after Gregory doing business with the New <a href="../Setting/Crescent%20Shadows.html">Crescent Shadows</a> pack, but Gregory refuses to indulge him, and reminds Julian that Gregory didn't sell him out to the pack even when they asked him to. The conversation shifts to more casual subjects, and Wren withdraws their senses from the Flesh. Wren has a grudge against them, the nature of which isn't entirely clear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> relays what they've seen to <a href="../Setting/LeShaun%20White.html">LeShaun White</a>. <a href="../Setting/Samuel%20Hanselman.html">Samuel Hanselman</a> seems to have the most Renown of the present pack, but is content to be second to LeShaun. After some discussion amongst the pack, Wren pops into the Flesh, taunts Gregory, and flees toward a known locus with the intent of leading the two of them into an ambush. While waiting for their pursuers, Wren pulls out their phone and makes a call, asking someone to wait for them a couple of blocks away; the person reluctantly agrees. Wren is in Urshul form at this point.</li>
<li>Shortly after, an older red wolf with lighter highlights and a black wolf with silver highlights appear and give chase. They quickly begin to catch up to <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and, despite them shifting into Urhan form to widen the gap, they're overtaken, but manage to dodge and pull ahead again.</li>
<li>Having just seen <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> be taken, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> shifts, travels to a locus, and (despite some difficulty) travels through the Gauntlet. Just before, she texts <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> about what's happened. After crossing, she attempts to get a scent and senses that <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> passed through here not long before. In Urhan form, she's able to catch up shortly after and quickly explains what happen. The three shift into Urshul form and speed back to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s house to try to find any spirits who may have seen <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s abduction.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> announces to the spirits near <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s house that he'll award 2 Essence to a spirit who can give them information about <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s abduction. A lamp spirit saw that Su Ubh dragged Miguel away toward Center Pallace Shopping Center downtown, where Dade and <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> were just heading before <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> found them. They thank the lamp spirit, return to HQ to meet up with <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, and from there track Su Ubh.</li>
<li>The Pack finds multiple nests in the shopping center, the lower of which contain human remains. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> manages to reach a nest and finds <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> looking incredibly malnourished. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> uses a point of Willpower (putting him at 5), uses the <a href="../System/Banish.html">Banish</a> ritual, and prays to Luna to return Alex to the Umbra, causing his body to fade and disappear.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> discovers that the Collector takes humans touched by the supernatural (in the case of <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>) with the intention of returning them to its nest to care for them, and does them no harm unless they attempt to escape, not unlike a magpie's affinity for shiny things. The Pack hears crying from another nest and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> hears the flapping of wings moving faster toward them than a car. Su Ubh arrives and, upon seeing the Pack, flees.</li>
<li>Amongst human gore, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> finds a locket containing photos of a father and son; a cracked mirror; the shirt, jeans, and skull of an adult human; moldly spirit remains and water; and a message written in blood onto the concrete support of the nest saying, &quot;Sorry, Timmy. I couldn't get out. Miss you.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> expends 2 more Willpower (putting him at 3) to climb and manages to reach the second nest; <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> follows. They find <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> in the second nest. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> performs <a href="../System/Banish.html">Banish</a> on Miguel as well. The Pack returns to the Flesh. Dade calls 911 and requests an ambulance to their location to get <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>. Miguel finally awakens, realizes where he is and that his mother is there with him, and bursts into tears and falls into her arms. After a moment, she ushes him away, and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> leaves as well.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gets 1 Beat for attendance and 1 Beat for recap.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gains 1 Beat for discovering the identity of the Magpie Man, putting him at 17 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Star: Enjoyed seeing <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> go on a hunt with the rest of the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> and their display of passion (even if the destructive sort) toward something (in this case killing <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>). Curious about what's causing this particular disposition of theirs; I feel like I'm missing the context to explain it. Didn't expect these character paths to intersect.</li>
<li>Star: Weaving the rest of the Pack into the plot thread about the Magpie Man by having it kidnap <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> was really creative, as was making it the cause of <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>'s disappearance. I never would've guessed any of them would end up being related. Really enjoyed seeing that play out.</li>
<li>Wish: I don't think we ever hashed out what happened to <a href="../Setting/Unseen%20Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> after the battle with <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>. We should probably address that.</li>
<li>Wish: It's been cool having the <a href="../Setting/Night%20Watch.html">Night Watch</a> be involved in the story. I could see that leading to opportunities for the Pack to meet and interact with supernatural beings that aren't Uratha, spirits, or hunters (e.g. Kindred, mages, wraiths, etc).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For as long as it's been an element of the chronicle, I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes of the Pack scoping out the church to learn more about <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>.</li>
<li>Current aspirations:
<ul>
<li>L - Discover the identity of the spirit I encountered at my apartment (AKA &quot;Magpie Man&quot;)
<ul>
<li>Need to replace this one. Could or should I convert the one to help Little Shadow speak English from a short-tetrm to a long-term?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>S - Learn more about the activities of the Lupus et Fidelis church on the night of one of their worship sessions
<ul>
<li>Should get to this one next session</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>S - Help Little Shadow to start speaking English again
<ul>
<li>If I can convert this one to long-term, I could replace it with gaining admittance to the <a href="../Setting/Amber%20Club.html">Amber Club</a>
</li>
