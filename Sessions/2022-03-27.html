<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Background music is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgQwst5OFmA">Kai Engel - Brume</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> are in the throes of Basu-Im, the former two for 10 minutes and the latter for 15 due to their respective Primal Urge ratings. The three are turning their attention to <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, the only remaining Pack member save for <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> who is not in Basu-Im.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> meets up with <a href="../Setting/Mason.html">Mason</a>, an old flame, outside of a theater for a movie date. He shows up in a t-shirt and jeans, driving his Cadillac. After some banter, he presents Wren with a box of chocolates. The two go in, Mason purchases some snacks for them, and they seat themselves for the movie. Wren allows Mason to hold their hand. It's established at this point that Wren is polyamorous, but hasn't revealed this yet to either of <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> or <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> begins having a hyperrealistic vision. The movie theater becomes one that looks like it's been abandoned for centuries, with holes in each floor leading to Luna shining down from outside. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> enter the room in Basu-Im. Wren tries to remain calm on the chance that the vision is noninteractive, stands, and starts to exit the theater, but is painfully tackled to the ground by one of wolves. They continue their attempt to escape, at the same time realizing that the Pack must be in Basu-Im wherever they are in the real world. The vision ends abruptly with <a href="../Setting/Mason.html">Mason</a> prompting their attention, having noticed they seemed to be &quot;zoning out.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking they're dehydrated, <a href="../Setting/Mason.html">Mason</a> leaves briefly to get <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> some water. <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> then shows up and talks with Wren briefly. The conversation indicates that they've intentionally hid her and their relationship with her from the Pack. Mention is made of the two of them going on a Hunt together. Rebecca is worried and feels her safety would be threatened if the Pack discovered her. She places her hand on Wren, instilling a feeling of bliss and the Stunned Tilt Condition (p. 313), then leaves. Mason returns with the water and keeps his attention on Wren through the rest of the movie to ensure that they're alright. Wren brings up the possibility of introducing Mason to <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. The date ends and Mason leaves Wren to return home to rest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Your character is dazed and unable to think straight. Maybe her vision blurs. If she’s stunned as a result of a blow to the head, she’s probably got a concussion.
<strong>Effect</strong>: A character with the Stunned Tilt loses her next action, and halves her Defense until she can next act.
<strong>Causing the Tilt</strong>: A character can be stunned by any attack that does at least as much damage as her Size in a single hit. Some weapons have a “stun” special ability. These double the weapon modifier only for the purpose of working out whether the attacker inflicts the Stunned Tilt. Attacks against the target’s head (see “Specified Targets,” p. 168) count the character’s Size as one lower for the purposes of this Tilt. The Storyteller might determine that additional effects cause this Tilt, like being caught in the blast area of an explosion.
<strong>Ending the Tilt</strong>: The effects of this Tilt normally only last for a single turn. The character can end the Tilt during her own action by reflexively spending a point of Willpower to gather her wits, though she suffers a –3 modifier to any actions she takes that turn.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> tracks <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s scent in attempt to locate her and the other Pack members, and finds them after about 20 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background music switches to <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=e8zZyMZA94Q">God of War OST - Magni and Modi [Extended]</a>. Focus returns to the scene of the fight from last session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> swipes her claws at <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, dealing 4 Lethal damage, putting him at 5 Lethal and 1 Aggravated. He fails a Stamina check and falls unconscious. The Pack no longer considers him a worthy target and shifts their attention from him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> attempts to snipe at <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>'s leg (see Specified Targets, p. 168), but misses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> also attacks <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> and manages to tear off her entire tail, leaving a gaping Essence wound trailing blood behind her. She screams in pain and her form begins flickering. She spends 1 Essence to flee at double speed, gaining a large lead but still one that can be tracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> gives chase to <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> both pause and attempt unsuccessfully to wail on the ice diamond housing <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> before realizing their attempts are in vain and give up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To more rounds go by, and because he's bleeding out, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> upgrades another 2 more Legal damage to Aggravated (putting him at 3 Aggravated), and continues to do so each round until he receives medical treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> finds the blizzard and scene of the battle (with no one else still present there) and figures out that the battle must've transitioned to the Shadow. They spend 1 Essence to shift from Hishu into Urshul form, travel to the nearby fire hydrant locus, and transition to the Shadow. They come upon the scene of the current fight and manage to stop <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s bleeding, stabilizing his condition so that he no longer continues taking damage each round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> continues chasing <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> with an extended contested roll of 20 successes (Clara 4 vs Unseen Fire 21 in 2 rounds). Unseen Fire escapes, fades out of sight, and is removed from the battle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> stops wailing on the ice diamond prison upon noticing <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> and charges at them with a claw attack aimed at their eyes, dealing 3 Lethal and completely removing Wren's eyes (dealing an additional 2 Aggravated) and rending the Blinded Condition (p. 312) on them (for which they take 1 Beat). <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> then attacks Wren, who now has no Defense due to the Blinded Condition, and deals 4 Lethal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> heals 1 Lethal damage naturally per round for 3 rounds, putting him at 3 Aggravated (which will take 4 in-game days per point, so 12 days to heal all of it). He succeeds on a Stamina check and comes to, but still feels too overwhelmed by pain to move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> transitions to dodging, assessing a -2 penalty against anyone who tries to attack them. They attempt use their Knotted Paths Gift (p. 129) on <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, but only manage to trap the latter with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In frustration, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> wails against an elm tree, inflicting multiple cracks into its trunk even as its spirit begs her to stop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> bites at <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>'s head, dealing another 3 Lethal damage and nearly killing them. Basu-Im ends for both Paca and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>; they collapse into Hishu form with no memory of what's transpired and each lose 1 Harmony. Clara having done Lethal damage to <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> invokes her Trigger. Paca finds a first aid kit on Wren and uses it to stabilize them and bring them to. Clara makes her way back to the scene. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> is still in Basu-Im, but still trapped. <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> chides the Pack for their predicament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Pack save for <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> moves out of earshot, then <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> tells them how to break the <a href="../System/Shadowbind.html">Shadowbind</a> rite imprisoning <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>: within earshot of the prison, say &quot;captive, go free&quot; in Latin. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> eventually comes out of Basu-Im, but maintains his current Harmony. The entire Pack is obviously traumatized by the experience, and all attempt to self-comfort or comfort each other. The Hunt is considered concluded because Hanzer-gah Ninna remains imprisoned. Paca resolves the Madness condition imposed on her by Hanzer-gah Ninna on <a href="2022-03-13.html">2022-03-13</a> and takes 1 Beat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> offers to take <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> (since <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> is too injured to care for him) and <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> (allowing them to stay in her guestroom, since their Blinded Condition will make it difficult for them to care for themselves). <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> helps to get <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> home and applies further first aid to help him heal, reducing his time to heal each Aggravated damage from 4 to 2 days. They all arrive home at approximately dawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> manage to get inside without alerting <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> to their presence. Paca gets Wren settled in her guest room, then walks into the kitchen and finds Miguel making his lunch for school and coldly unresponsive to her attempts to greet him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wren attempts to leave the guest room, but smacks into the door. Paca and Miguel go to the guest room; Paca helps Wren up as Miguel, in shock, swears at Paca. When Paca tries to tell him the truth and Miguel won't believe her, she shifts into Dalu form to prove it to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> sends <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> an encouraging text later: &quot;&lt;3 Hey. We did it.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone receives 1 Beat for each of attendance, recap, and resolving the Siskur-Dah condition and another 3 Beats for completing the battle with <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>.</li>
<li>Dade takes 1 Beat for completing his short-term aspiration of going on a Sacred Hunt for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, putting him at 50.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Small oversight from last session: one of the short-term aspirations for <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> last session was to &quot;go on a Sacred Hunt for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>,&quot; whic he technically completed (even if the Hunt was not completed), but he gained no Beats for and did not replace with a new short-term aspiration.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s idea to restore <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>'s sight:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Take some glass eyes</li>
<li>Make them a Fetish Object with a spirit of &quot;knowing&quot;</li>
<li>Whoever &quot;wears&quot; the eyes gets their sight back, with strange spirit benefits</li>
</ul>
<p>(An owl spirit may give a bonus to finding rodents, a love spirit may give a bonus to reading body language for signs of attraction, a Logic Spirit may help with Computers and Academics, etc.)</p>
