<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> is at HQ and spends an hour cleaning while waiting for the rest of the pack. <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> seems pleased with <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> for their contribution.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> ushers <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> away, and attempts to tend to <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a>'s wounds.</li>
<li>As <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> gets outside of <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a> HQ, she receives a phone call from <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> explains that they're hiding out at HQ because they were expelled from the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> and their ambivalence at the deaths of <a href="../Setting/LeShaun White.html">LeShaun White</a> and <a href="../Setting/Bridget Byreen.html">Bridget Byreen</a>.</li>
<li>Once <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> has called 911 and seen to each of the members of the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a>, he leaves the scene and follows <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> to the Pack's HQ.</li>
<li>As <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> arrive at HQ, they find <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> laying face-down in the corner of the room. After a brief exchange, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> goes to make some tea for <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>. As she does so, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> uses the gift of Luna's Embrace (p. 136-137) to change their gender to male, then rises and follows after <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> arrives at HQ to it looking cleaner and those present there having tea together. After the other Pack members attempt to reassure and comfort them, <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> goes to a nearby couch and falls asleep.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> discuss venturing to The Last Firstborn to investigate the leads provided by <a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a> regarding <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> has the ability to learn All Doors Locked (p. 135), but must learn it from a spirit. They cross into the Spirit, then travel to the office of Sweet Relief Security, whose slogan is, &quot;It's all about trust, and we got that.&quot; The office exists as a heaily guarded fortress in the Hisil. Keys with arms and legs march around it, keeping watch. As <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> approaches, she is greeted by a spirit who calls itself the Keymaster. When she explains her request, and after an intense but short delay, the Keymaster obliges her for 2 Essence and putting a good word in for it with other security-focused spirits (as well as 3 XP).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> return to HQ, transition to the Flesh, and travel to The Last Firstborn by bus. When they arrive, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> attempts to feign finding the restroom while looking for the basement entrance. She takes the Leveraged tilt (p. 308) and agrees to come back within three days and give the bouncer $5 for &quot;directions to the bathroom.&quot; The bouncer opens the basement door for her, winks, and tells her to be quick. She moves out of <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s line of sight down the stairs, and the door closest behind her. He uses Pack Awareness of keep tabs on her.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> descends into the basement and finds a bedroom, just as <a href="../Setting/Gregory.html">Gregory</a> described. She is able to get into the adjacent room and finds it filled with wolf deity iconography. As she enters, she is greeted by the voice of <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>, who is kneeling in prayer, saying, &quot;Welcome, my lady.&quot; In attempting to question her, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> finds her to be genuinely unaware of her supernatural abilities, nor does she smell of being Uratha or Wolf-blooded.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> expends 1 Essence and uses Echo Dream (p. 125-126). She sees a vision of <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>, with spiderweb cracks running through her mind, walking confidently, amidst a small army being eviscerated by monsters. She kneels in supplication to a gigantic shadow of a wolf, but cast by a being not entirely like a wolf. Blood falls from this being, which <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> takes into herself, then releases back out Uratha, not under her command but perfected. The vision concluded, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> falls into Death Rage.</li>
<li>After some cajoling, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> convinces the bouncer to investigate the basement, then follows after him. After hearing the bouncer ask if everything is alright, and hearing <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> confirm it, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> follows suit and falls into Death Rage himself.</li>
<li>After 10 minutes, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> come to their senses. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> finds he is covered in human blood; <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> has some as well, though less. They find a bullet lodged in the wall opposite them halfway up the staircase, and can hear police sirens around the building. The room behind them is wrecked. The bouncer is dead and <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> is gone.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> expends another Essence to use All Doors Locked again to find another exists in the vicinity and finds that the bedroom has a backdoor next to the closet. They take the door and leads into a back alleyway out of view of the police. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 0) to steathily move out of the alley with <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> return to his apartment and clean themselves. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> tells <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> about her vision. The two resolve to meet with the other Pack members before taking any further action against <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> or <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gains 1 Beat for attendance.</li>

</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes :
<ul>
<li>Star: Loved that <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> was able to get All Doors Locked and put it to good use this session. It's a very neat ability.</li>
<li>Star: Definitely did not expect to run into <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> at The Last Firstborn. That made for quite the turn of events, particularly the vision <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> had, and made me all the more curious about her.</li>
<li>Wish: It was interesting to see that <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a> apparently seems ignorant of the nature or source of her ability to instigate Death Rage. Still curious to see if she and <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> are somehow connected.</li>
<li>Wish: <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> hasn't had much of a presence the last few sessions, which makes progression of my long-term aspiration dificult.</li>
</ul>
