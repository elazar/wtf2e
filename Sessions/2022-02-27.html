<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> lose the trail of <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> in the junkyard. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is cautiously inducted into the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a>. The Pack meets at HQ, discusses having <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> join them, confronts a Fettered spirit in the junkyard, and continues attempting to track <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Background music is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgQwst5OFmA">Kai Engel - Brume</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> lose the scent of <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> on the other side of the junkyard. Dade rolls (Wits + Streetwise / Survival) and burns 1 Willpower (putting him at 5), but fails dramatically and gains the Lost Tracker condition (p. 308). Little Shadow shifts into Dalu form and attempts to find the scent as well, but also fails. Dade texts <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and asks if they can meet at HQ.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is blindfolded by <a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> and led on his arm to the Hunters' hideout.
<ul>
<li>A woman approximately in her 30's with a rather melodious voice and blonde hair comes down the stairs in high heels, who the cell members refer to Joy and. She's identified as the &quot;face&quot; of the group.</li>
<li>Tom is fairly muscular and doesn't seem to talk much. He's identified as the &quot;bulldozer&quot; of the group.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Cheryll.html">Cheryll</a>, the dark-haired woman that Paca previously encountered, is the group's intelligence gatherer. Paca had a run-in with her on <a href="2022-01-09.html">2022-01-09</a>.</li>
<li>Paca identifies herself to the cell only as &quot;P.&quot; She is sworn in to the cell as a member and issued a flashlight until she exhibits her skills and most suitable role within the group.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Rafeeq Jackson.html">Rafeeq Jackson</a> refers to the cell as the <a href="../Setting/Night Watch.html">Night Watch</a>. They apparently conduct their activities in an underground survivalist bunker of some sort.</li>
<li>While using the building's restroom, Paca encounters a rather large rat, but unfortunately fails to converse with it.</li>
<li>Rafeeq leads Paca out of their headquarters, blindfolded again, 30-45 minutes after she was led in. She provides her mobile number of Rafeeq and tells him to call her if needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Pack meets at HQ to discuss the findings from the patrol done by <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, and <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>. They discuss the possibility of <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> joining the Pack; <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> says she will consider what trial Clara will undertake in order to join.</li>
<li>The Pack manages to pick up a stale trail of <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> and returns to the junkyard, where they again find the man that <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> encountered the last time he was there, apparently digging through the trash for food.
<ul>
<li>The man apparently doesn't recall how long he's been in the junkyard. When <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> asks his name, he identifies himself as Eddie, and reiterates his self-proclaimed title of &quot;King of the World.&quot;</li>
<li>While <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> distracts Eddie, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> manage to sneak past them and into the junkyard, but <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> steps on a tin can and draws Eddie's attention to his presence.</li>
<li>Paca punches Eddie, thinking he's drawing a weapon to hurt Little Shadow, that turns out to be a birdhouse that's now cracked. Paca then jumps on him and wails on him. He reaches up and touches Paca, dealing 5 bashing damage to her as he begins to somehow magically starts to drain the life from her.</li>
<li>As Paca overtakes Eddie, a spirit with visible decay that was inhabiting his body exits and becomes visible to the Pack in twilight. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> sees a link between the two indicating this spirit to be Fettered (p. 190). He shifts into Urshul form and issues a challenge to the spirit, asking him to provide a reason why he shouldn't be killed, as the rest of the Pack joins in, jeering at the spirit and banging nearby trash can lids together as they successfully Banish the spirit to the Shadow.</li>
<li>The Pack is able to pick up the trail of <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a> again, out of the junkyard and into abandoned (albeit still intact) buildings. We started an extended contested check to pick it up again. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is at 0, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> is at 1, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> are at 4.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for session recap and 1 Beat for attendance.</li>
<li>Dade takes 1 Beat for the dramatic failure in tracking <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>.</li>
<li>Everyone takes 1 Beat for the very cinematic way that they banished the spirit inhabiting Eddie.</li>
<li>Dade takes 1 Beat for further progress toward going on a hunt for <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, putting him at 38 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>More potential ways to combat <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>:
<ul>
<li>Fetishes (p. 141, 146)</li>
<li>Forge Alliance (p. 142)
<ul>
<li>We could join with the <a href="../Setting/Cadillac Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> if they're willing, though it would take someone powerful enough to perform the Rite</li>
