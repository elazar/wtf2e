<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> comforts <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> after he is saved from Su Ubh. The <a href="../Setting/Cadillac%20Company.html">Cadillac Company</a> trades babs with <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> and <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> before the two groups part ways. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> is possessed by the lune inhabiting <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>I was not present for this session.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> went with <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. Miguel was in shock over what he'd experienced and refused to go to sleep. Clara explained a few things about Uratha to him, including Paca's frequent absences and her shifting in front of him.</li>
<li>Clara's &quot;buddy spirit&quot; made an experience, warning her of the potential effects of what Miguel had undergone in regards to Lunacy, having been in the Shadow, etc.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> talked <a href="../Setting/LeShaun%20White.html">LeShaun White</a> into doubting his own mission to take down the Pure, accusing him of doing so solely to claim the city as their own. <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> got into a debate with <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> over the inherent goodness of Mother Luna and whether she was worth following.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> later called on Broken Mirror, the lune possessing <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a>, to possess them (putting them at Harmony 8, meaning they can shift from Shadow to Flesh without a locus), which they had allowed before (once for 13 days straight). It is ostensibly possible for Broken Mirror could absolutely turn them into a Claimed. The lune is apparently a Touchstone for <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>.</li>
