<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> looks further into <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> enter the sewers to pursue <a href="../Setting/Mooth%20Hirabayu.html">Mooth Hirabayu</a> and the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a>.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Unsure of the nature of the spirit he encountered on <a href="2021-08-01.html">2021-08-01</a>, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> and asks for a meeting. He replies to meet him Tuesday (in a couple of days) at the same location as last time (on <a href="2021-05-16.html">2021-05-16</a>, at the old opera house) and to bring a pack of beer, a turkey sub, and some rose petals.</li>
<li>The Fire-Touched have taken the east side of Detroit as their territory, which contains a lot of churches. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> goes near their territory to investigate <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a> and encounters a small group, who call him Reverend Graves and describe him as an occasionally intense street preacher, but otherwise sing his praises, and point him to a few locations where he gives sermons most inside their territory and one near it, but at random times.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> and requests that he call, intending to ask him about Graves, but only gets back that his text was read; Whistler doesn't reply.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 1 Essence (putting him at 5) to activate the Shadow Hunter ability of his <a href="../System/Crescent%20Moon's%20Gift.html">Crescent Moon's Gift</a> for the duration of the current hunt for <a href="../Setting/Mooth%20Hirabayu.html">Mooth Hirabayu</a>. Upon meeting at HQ, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> take 5 and 4 Essence respectively (putting Dade at 10) from the locus there.</li>
<li>Tonight is a half moon. Next week is the Sunday of the full moon.</li>
<li>The pack enters the sewer where they last saw <a href="../Setting/Mooth%20Hirabayu.html">Mooth Hirabayu</a>. There, they hear voices, speaking in First Tongue, one seemingly giving a sermon, another giving a sarcastic comment.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> throw molotov cocktails into the space where they encounter the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> and <a href="../Setting/Mooth%20Hirabayu.html">Mooth Hirabayu</a>.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 5) to improve his effort, spends 2 Essence to reflexively shift into Urshul form, then bites the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> and deals 3 Lethal damage.</li>
<li>A swarm of rats deal 1 Bashing damage to <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> which he heals next round.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> expends 1 Willpower (putting him at 4) and rakes the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> with his claws, dealing 2 Lethal damage.</li>
<li>The <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a>'s form discorporates, dissolving into a hoard of rats, and it escapes.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> tears the body possessed by <a href="../Setting/Mooth%20Hirabayu.html">Mooth Hirabayu</a> in half, slaying the Ridden.</li>
