<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> bring <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> to a safe place to be nursed back to health. <a href="../Setting/David%20Stanze.html">David Stanze</a> pays them a visit. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> kills him to protect the Pack.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> take the car and head back to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s place with <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. As they pass down a stretch of highway near the woods, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> feels their call bidding him to return soon under threat of compulsion. They reach their destination and lay <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> on the couch, enduring hard-to-read stares from <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah%20Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>.</li>
<li>There's a knock at the door. It's a small dark-skinned man wearing a robe and looking very nervous. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> sends <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> upstairs with <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, then goes to the door, noticing that the man smells human and has the look of prey. After some conversation, <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> realizes that he's <a href="../Setting/David%20Stanze.html">David Stanze</a> and beckons him inside.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> chooses to break the Oath of the Moon and reveals the existence of Uratha and his identity as one to David, which shatters him. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> shows willingness to kill him, but <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> dissuades her, borrows her keys, and takes David with him.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> calls <a href="../Setting/Gregory%20Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>, who expresses that he can't do anything that <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> couldn't do himself; he declines the offer. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> comes back out and offers to take care of disposing of <a href="../Setting/David%20Stanze.html">David Stanze</a>, but <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> declines, saying that he chose to break the Oath and that this should be his responsibility.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> drives, all the while attempting to find an option that doesn't involve killing <a href="../Setting/David%20Stanze.html">David Stanze</a>, and managing to spur David's anger and hatred in the process. In the end, he makes an unconvincing offer to leave the cult and keep a low profile. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> decides that he can't take the chance, spends 1 Essence (putting him at 7) to shift into Dalu form, quickly mouths an apology, and snaps David's neck. He fails a breaking point roll and his Harmony reduces by 1, putting him at 6.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> calls <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>, who points him to a tarp and duct tape in the trunk of the car. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> wraps <a href="../Setting/David%20Stanze.html">David Stanze</a> in them, drives to a graveyard by a nearby farm, digs up the bottom of an open grave, and buries him there, then drives back to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s to return her keys.</li>
<li>The <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> condition persists, as the hunt for the Claimed hasn't been completed yet.</li>
<li>The Pack prepares to continue their Hunt for <a href="../Setting/Mooth%20Hirabayu.html">Mooth Hirabayu</a>, and potentially the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> if the Hunt takes them into the sewers.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends downtime investigating <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> and <a href="../Setting/Julian%20Graves.html">Julian Graves</a>. At one point, he unmistakeably hears his father Michael's voice.
<ul>
<li>Strength + Brawl - 1 success</li>
<li>Wits + Composure + Primal Urge - 1 success</li>
<li>He spends 1 Essence (putting him at 6) to use Shadow Gaze - 2 successes</li>
<li>The spirit's bans: 1) if he fails to draw a human out of their home by the dawn, he can't take them with him. Any uses of mimicry automatically fail, though he can continue to apply them; 2) he is unable to enter a building unless a door or window is open, and can only attempt to lure a single victim for a single night, and can't pursue those individuals again.</li>
<li>The spirit grapples and paralyzes <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, but then silently lets go. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> feels a flash of fear and annoyance from it, then it vanishes into the Shadow. After a few minutes of paralysis, he shuts the door and no longer hears voices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 1 Beat for session attendance.</li>
<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 1 Beat for session recap.</li>
<li>Everyone in the Pack receives 1 Beat for an extended session. (We ran until 9:30).</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> takes 1 Beat for his first time enduring a Harmony shift, putting him at 15 Beats.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 15 Beats for 1 Wisdom Renown (putting it at 3), causing <a href="../System/Crescent%20Moon's%20Gift.html">Crescent Moon's Gift</a> to gain 1 rating automatically (putting it at 3) and leaving him with 1 Beat remaining.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Last session, off-screen, when <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> was alone in the house, she was suspicious and used a Moon Gift to speak with <a href="../Setting/David%20Stanze.html">David Stanze</a> in an alternate timeline of sorts and had a conversation similar (albeit more friendly) than the one <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> ended up having with him.</li>
