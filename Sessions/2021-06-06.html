<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The Pack seeks out more information about <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, and allies ahead of their meeting with the spirit court of Hope.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> consult with <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>. She suggests extreme caution if they choose to deal with the <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a>, a Magath who inhabits the library, used to be a spirit of a stray animal, absorbed the essence of all the knowledge there and it corrupted him. She suggests contacting a faith spirit for further knowledge of <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a>, or the community spirit for help due to its concern for the community's welfare. She also advises them to keep an eye on <a href="../Setting/Muthgah Ninna.html">Muthgah Ninna</a>, the guardian spirit of <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>; he makes her very uneasy.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> takes 3 Essence from the locus, putting him at a full 10 for his current Primal Urge of 1. He and <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> use the locus to cross into the Shadow with <a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a>. The community spirit would be with the spirit court of Hope and is thus inaccessible until the Pack approaches them. Dade is unaware of any likely locations of a faith spirit outside of the church location that <a href="../Setting/John Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> gave them, which is dangerous.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> recalls a nearby Catholic church in the Pack's territory, where they may be able to find a faith spirit. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 1 Essence and uses Spirit Whispers (see <a href="../System/Crescent Moon's Gift.html">Crescent Moon's Gift</a>) to summon the spirit of a pipe organ within the church, asking it who if anyone has attachment to the <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> cult, but it is a rank 1 spirit tied to its location and has no relevant knowledge.</li>
<li>They're then approached by a small spirit inhabiting a manila folder of records. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> spends 1 Essence to use [Shadow Gaze] (see <a href="../System/Crescent Moon's Gift.html">Crescent Moon's Gift</a>) on the spirit, learning that its bane is fire, and uses <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a>'s lighter to convince it to give up any knowledge it has on congregation connections to <a href="../Setting/Lupus et Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> for 1 Essence. It gives them two names: <a href="../Setting/Gloria Stanze.html">Gloria Stanze</a>, which they recognize from the news report as <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s victim from the Smokey Bottle Bar, and <a href="../Setting/David Stanze.html">David Stanze</a>, presumably a relative of hers, who left the church for the cult a few months ago. It also gives them an address for the Stanze household, which is in the downtown area and within the territory of the Pure.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Tribal Oath is to seek to not antagonize the denizens of the Shadow needlessly, formulated in First Tongue as &quot;Su A Sar-Hith Sa,&quot; or &quot;Pay Each Spirit in Kind.&quot; The Bone Shadows seek to treat the denizens of the Shadow realm fairly. That means repayment of debt or honoring promises, but also the punishment of a spirit who tries to cross one of the Hirfathra Hissu.&quot; ~ Thunder</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Iâ€™m not sure how well the church spirits will take a simple apology; given how spirits work, they might want something more. And there is a ritual for asking for spiritual forgiveness. Page 145 in the textbook. Normally 3 dots but given your <a href="../System/Auspice.html">Auspice</a> the price is halved. So you could get the rite easily with Experience; youâ€™d just need to find either a spirit or a wolf to teach you it, if you want to go that way. Remember the Bone Shadows oath.&quot; ~ Thunder</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>After leaving the church, the Pack receives an e-mail from <a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a>: &quot;Sent a man in. He's reported back that the highest of the local church branch can perform a remote rituals that forces werewolves to execute a Hunt for the cult. Whoever struck the killing blow on <a href="../Setting/Gloria Stanze.html">Gloria Stanze</a> knows that the three of you are Uratha, though they don't know your names; watch yourselves. They're positively giddy; their gods have come. ðŸ˜‰ Going to pull my man out in a week.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> sends a reply: &quot;Found a relative of <a href="../Setting/Gloria Stanze.html">Gloria Stanze</a> who is in the cult. His former home is in Pure territory. We need safe passage to investigate.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Gregory Whistler.html">Gregory Whistler</a> responds: &quot;I cannot guarantee this. The Pure prize their territory as highly as you. You would have a better chance trying to catch him outside the territory. The Hounds used to be in my pack; perhaps you can convince them. They're wary of me given my progressive work, but I could try.&quot;</li>
<li>The Pack returns to <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s house to consult with <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> sees an owl spirit watching over Miguel as he sleeps. <a href="../Setting/Muthgah Ninna.html">Muthgah Ninna</a> appears to the Pack from the Shadow and looks markedly different from last they saw him: Urshul-sized and encompassed by fire.</li>
<li>She introduces herself as <a href="../Setting/Hanzer-gah Ninna.html">Hanzer-gah Ninna</a>, Predator with the Flaming Jaws; her name and essence have changed from her devouring of a fire spirit. She watches over <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Future Elric.html">Future Elric</a> also appears and greets <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a>. The former reassures the latter that the future will hold good things from the pack visiting the spirit court of Hope, and says he has influence with them. <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> calls <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> to move to the next room for a private conversation, which offends <a href="../Setting/Future Elric.html">Future Elric</a>, who then fades into the Shadow.</li>
<li>The patron of <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>'s tribe visits him in a dream, expressing disappointment over Little Shadow's lack of prowess in the Hunt. He despairs over the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> continuing to defile his old pack's territory. He says that if <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> spurs him into Garou form at the right time, when the pack confronts the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a>, he believes he can do so with them without fleeing.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> has the ability to speak with animals. After the Pack tells him about the cult's local church and the former residence of a suspected cult member, he disappears to consult with an animal spirit group to see if he can convince them to perform some reconnaissance for the Pack.</li>
<li>The Pack has a brief experience of the Shadow's nature and proximity permeating themselves and their surroundings. Words pass on the wind from the tribe's patrons, the Firstborn.</li>
<li>While in the kitchen, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> gets the sense that someone is watching her, and saw her kill <a href="../Setting/Gloria Stanze.html">Gloria Stanze</a>. She has a vision reliving the murder, then approaches the mysterious robed woman, but begins howling with her, even in the presence of other bar patrons, as the woman prostrates herself before Paca before she runs into a nearby alley and claws into the stone wall until she collapses. Sagrim-Ur gives Paca the vision, and says, &quot;I was not going to make you a mass murderer; not my child.&quot; They seem to know her intimately, calling her by name.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> has a vision and sees a storm outside and hears a message on the wind from Skolis-Ur: &quot;Lead by example, if not by place. You are not weak; I've decreed it so. You will lead them well. Your prey is nearer than you think.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> has a vision and sees the Shadow and the Flesh in their state of constantly feeding each other in a loop, affecting each other endlessly, and can hear Kamaduis-Ur speaking to him: &quot;The spirits are yours, the Shadow must be ruled. Keep to the balance and you will not go wrong. Beware an enemy who lies close.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Unseen Fire.html">Unseen Fire</a> appears, saying she has spoken with the spirit court of Hope and they're willing to receive the Pack the following night. They plan on putting the Pack through a test of some kind. <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> returns from the Shadow at about 2am and goes to sleep. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a> crash at <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s.</li>
<li>The Pack experiences another vision saying &quot;beware the invisible predator&quot; and receives the <a href="../System/Inspired.html">Inspired</a> condition. In the case of <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, the message from Skolis-Ur is the source of the condition.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you make a roll connecting to the source of whatever inspired you (and you can ask me if it would count), you only need three successes for it to count as exceptional instead of five, and you gain a point of Willpower back.&quot; ~ Thunder</p>
