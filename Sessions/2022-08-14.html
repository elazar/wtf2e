<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> discuss the situation with <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> briefly and ultimatley decide to let them go.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> tells <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> to let him know if there's anything he can do to help, then leaves to allow Paca and <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> to speak amongst themselves.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> still seems shaken by the odd encounter with <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> (see <a href="2022-07-31.html">2022-07-31</a>); Paca explains that situations of this nature are part of why she hid her werewolf nature from him, and can see that Lunacy lingers in him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> travels to the library, crosses over to the Shadow, and finds <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a>.
<ul>
<li>She asks for its help in discerning the nature of what <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> is. It agrees, for the price of another boon: find a stray animal and find it a home.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> agrees, and tells it what she's learned: Horace seems to have reptilian features, insisted that she eat his food, and has the ability to tranquilize Uratha.</li>
<li>Remaining in the Shadow, <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> interacts with one of the library computers, attempting to find more information on ways to mute her rage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> returns to his apartment to make a steak breakfast for <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>. They discuss the state of things with <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> and <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> does internet research on <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>.
<ul>
<li>That have been reports of some strange happenings at the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a>, such as people being persuaded to eat their own limbs.</li>
<li>Horace is the richest man in the city by far, has a reputation as a deal-maker, and is known for the quality and expense of his personal security force.</li>
<li>Horace is part of a family dynasty of sorts, a rather dysfunctional one in which its members compete to prove their worth for inheriting partriarchal family secrets.</li>
<li>Horace also has an interest in occult relics and tends to keep them fairly secure. He has contacts in the black market, financial institutions, government, high society, and police. He has no immediate family in the area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> receives a call saying that Alex has woken up and is asking for him, that he's important somehow but he's unsure why, and that he's given descriptions of <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and <a href="../Setting/Elric.html">Elric</a>. Dade visits him later that afternoon.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> has darker rings under his eyes and longer, messier hair than when <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> last saw him. He seems to have some vague residual memories of his sudden rise to and fall from fame (the latter of which he seems to believe was triggered by the Smokey Bottle Bar incident on <a href="2021-04-25.html">2021-04-25</a>) and what happened in the Shadow on <a href="2022-06-05.html">2022-06-05</a>.</li>
<li>After a prompt from <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>, <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> says that something offered him a pact, gave him exactly what he wanted, was with him all the time, was pleased with him, doesn't like Dade, and left now because of him. Dade gazes into the Shadow and sees an impression of a chain attached to his head, as if a spirit had been chained or fettered there, but the chain (of a violet red shade) was broken. A fettering typically happens to make a subject more susceptible to influence.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> searches for a spirit to question, but can't find a single one to target in the chaos of the hospital. He then questions <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>'s nurse, who says he's been having nightmares, waking crying spells, and PTSD symptoms. Alex did recall hearing a baby cry on his doorstep and a bird (the Collector).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> spends a few hours communing with the data spirits in the library, trying to find more information about <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>.
<ul>
<li>She stumbles upon a journal written by a Uratha that she met at the <a href="../Setting/Amber Club.html">Amber Club</a> named Mark. It details his anguish stemming from his rage and people he's killed as a result, and points to involvement from <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a> and him being a Host (p. 202-205), though it's not specific as to what kind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> sneaks out (to avoid having to explain the situation to <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>) for her date with Roger.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> shares that she's a guidance counselor; Roger shares that he's been a coach for about 10 years. Paca discovers that Roger knows a man by the name of Sergeant White, who's the local police force.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> took a rideshare to the date and asks Roger to take her home; he obliges. The two arrange for a second date the next week. She surprises him with a parting kiss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gets 1 Beat for attendance and 1 Beat for recap.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gains 1 Beat for following up on <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> and 1 Beat for #stars-and-wishes, putting him at 34 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Things to do during the next day:

<li>
<del>Follow up with the mole about <a href="../Setting/Sister Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a></del> (only been 2 days since church mission)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ways to increase <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>'s Harmony above 4
<ul>
<li>p. 104, &quot;Breaking Points&quot;
<ul>
<li>Refusing to participate in Siskur-Dah</li>
<li>Staying out of the Hisil for a week (-1) or a month (-3)</li>
<li>Using a silver weapon against another werewolf</li>
<li>Violating the Oath of the Moon (-2)</li>
<li>Staying out of the Hisil for a month</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p. 68-71, &quot;Oath of the Moon&quot;
<ul>
<li>Refusing to hunt</li>
<li>Killing a Uratha, Wolf-Blood, or human pack member</li>
<li>Disrespecting an elder, pup, or young hunter</li>
<li>Disrespecting prey through unnecessary viciousness or killing</li>
<li>Eating human or wolf flesh</li>
<li>Expose the existence of Uratha to a human</li>
<li>Forsaking one's human side</li>
<li>Offering a surrender one would not accept</li>
<li>Refusing to pay a spirit</li>
<li>Allowing a sacred place in pack territory to be violated</li>
<li>Dishonoring pack territory</li>
<li>Allow another to witness or tend to weakness</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We'll start doing #stars-and-wishes instead of session recap next session. I need to get notes published and have a link I can drop into a new channel that Thunder will create.</li>
<li>Key brought up the possibility of silencing <a href="../Setting/Alex Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> somehow, e.g. having him committed to a mental institution.</li>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Star: I really loved <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s experience in the library while in the Shadow. The conversation with <a href="../Setting/Wise Lost.html">Wise Lost</a> was interesting, as always, but her interactions with the computers while in the Spirit were inspired!</li>
<li>Star: Paca finally got a date! And a useful social connection to boot! It'd be interesting if she ended up having a run-in with Sergeant White after committing that crime she's aspiring to.</li>
<li>Wish: I liked that <a href="../Setting/Little Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> had a bit more presence in this session. I'm hoping that we can figure out some way to help him with his Harmony.</li>
<li>Wish: I also liked that both <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> and <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> ended up doing their own research into <a href="../Setting/Horace Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>. Might be cool to see them pool their information and do some more detective work together.</li>
</ul>
