<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> breaks into <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s house to sleep with <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> talks with <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a>, meets with <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a>, and pays a visit to <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>. <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> goes to the <a href="../Setting/Amber%20Club.html">Amber Club</a> and meets with its benefactor. <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> is awakened and discovers that Wren is being influenced.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> breaks into <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s house by using a credit card to tap a window latch open. They scale into Paca's room and finds Paca collapsed on the floor and the owl spirit having just finishing rendering her unconscious. After confirming that she's alive, Wren moves into <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>'s room. She writes a message on a Post-It Note explaining her presence, then climbs into bed and cuddles with him without waking him.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> have breakfast. <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> brings up his parents and his need to speak English to be able to interact with them. He explains that his Harmony (4) physically prevents him from speaking anything other than First Tongue. Dade asks him to think on the available options.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> texts <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> and asks to meet with him. He agrees, for Burger King with a large fry this time.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> asks him about bringing <a href="../Setting/Little%20Shadow.html">Little Shadow</a> closer to the Flesh. Selby suggests putting Little Shadow into a situation of desperation to force him to break the Oath of the Moon (p. 68-71). <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>, being <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Elodoth">Elodoth</a>, could potentially pardon him for his offense if the reasoning is good.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> also asks him about <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>. <a href="../Setting/John%20Selbie.html">John Selbie</a> recalls seeing him in public with a lot of on-lookers, and a car swerved to avoid hitting him. The driver got out and immediately asked if he was okay. Selby reminds Dade of his promise to take him on the hunt with <a href="../System/Siskur-Dah.html">Siskur-Dah</a> for the Collector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> dresses up a bit and travels to the <a href="../Setting/Amber%20Club.html">Amber Club</a> and tells the bouncer that she's &quot;new,&quot; but doesn't immediately mention that she wants to see the owner. She's allowed in.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> goes into a room and has a vision. She sees a man-like creature removing a mucus/slime-like substance from his own body and using it to paint on the wall, which shimmers briefly before fading from view. The creature eventually moves to the next room and out of her view. She suspects the creature may be similar in nature to the <a href="../Setting/Beshilu.html">Beshilu</a> that's attempting to thicken the Gauntlet, which doesn't bode well for Uratha.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> is also propositioned by one of the night club patrons to take drugs, but she declines and the annoyed patron saunters off. Due to her exceptional success on a related roll, she can purchase either of the gifts Prey on Weakness (p. 125) or Scent the Unnatural (p. 126) mid-scene.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> tries but fails to find someone who can take her to the club's benefactor, and ends up lost somewhere inside the club. As the result of a dramatic failure, she suffers a -2 penalty to all Intelligence and Wits rolls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While in her deep sleep, <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> has a dream of being at a carnival with <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>, complete with a ride on a Ferris wheel. They visit a hot dog stand, and Paca is halfway through eating one before realizing that it's actually a human foot, and other hot dogs at the stand are actually various limbs dripping with Essence. Miguel also seems to realize what's going on, and argues that Paca is Uratha and has a right to eat humans.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> draws a mustache and bunch of complimentary words (&quot;nice,&quot; &quot;protective,&quot; etc.) on Paca's face with a marker as she sleeps, then makes breakfast for <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> as he continues to sleep. He eventually wakes, balks at her Post-It Note, and goes to find her cooking in the kitchen. Wren then has to explain what happened with <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and the owl spirit to him, and he starts exhibiting PTSD symptoms. He takes exception to them breaking in and sneaking into bed with him, and asks them to leave. Wren says they'll see him later when things have calmed down and he feels comfortable again, then takes their leave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> is able to get directions back to part of the club that she recognizes. From there, she's able to be guided to the same room <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> visited on <a href="2022-07-17.html">2022-07-17</a>, where she finds the same man, <a href="../Setting/Horace%20Fenchurch.html">Horace Fenchurch</a>, with the same table of exotic food, drink, and drugs.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a>'s reputation apparently precedes her, and he mentions <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> and his concern for her. The two discuss Clara's situation. Horace repeats his terms to her, as he did with Dade, then calls in Marcus, a large bearded tattooed <a href="../System/Auspice.html#Rahu">Rahu</a> of the <a href="../System/Tribe.html#Blood+Talons">Blood Talons</a>. Marcus attempts to assure Clara that accepting Horace's terms has very much helped him, despite his rather docile manner. Clara is able to sense his relief and the veracity of his words.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> is able to get Horace to agree to let her take a fruit tart from the table with her rather than eating it in front of him. She also allows her to leave still considering his offer, and tells her to let Marcus know if she decides to accept. She no longer has to pay admission for entry to the club.</li>
<li>Marcus shares with <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> that he isn't sure how Horace is able to silence his rage, though he is thankful for it, even if he suspects that Horace isn't himself human. Horace's Uratha do receive pay for their work; Marcus himself has done so for six months. After their conversation, he sees her out of the club.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> goes to the hospital to see <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a>. He seems to be suffering PTSD symptoms from his experience in the Shadow. He leaves his information with Alex's nurse and asks that she contact him if his condition changes.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> arrives at <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>'s house and finds a distraught <a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a>, who guides him to Paca. He finds the owl spirit, who explains the situation and clarifies that Paca can only be woken naturally. Dade has Miguel bring him a cup of ice water and a towel, which he proceeds to use to wake Paca. He then explains to Paca what has happened, while Miguel is visibly confused because he isn't aware of the existence of spirits. Paca shushes Dade, who immediately shuts up.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Miguel.html">Miguel</a> informs <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> that <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> broke into the house and is likely the source of the mustache on her face, which she (in a very deadpan fashion) seems unresponsive to. She then steps away to send a threatening text to Wren cautioning her against going near Miguel again.</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a> has gone randomly wandering around the city after being ejected from the house, and eventually sees <a href="../Setting/Rebecca.html">Rebecca</a> walking toward them from a distance. Wren walks away from her, which saddens her. Wren receives the text from <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a> and responds, not realizing who she is at first, and following it up with &quot;People are really hard to understand&quot; and then &quot;For what it's worth, I'm sorry for the confusion! I don't quite understand people... They were always Wren's forte.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Beats</h1>
<ul>
<li>1 Beat for attendance, 1 Beat for recap, and 3 Beats for &quot;having a great time.&quot;</li>
<li>
<a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> gains 1 Beat for making progress toward helping Little Shadow to start speaking English again and 1 Beat for gathering more information on Alex Cecil, putting him at 30 Beats.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>For #stars-and-wishes:
<ul>
<li>Star: Surprised that <a href="../Setting/Clara.html">Clara</a> decided to follow up on <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a>'s tip about the <a href="../Setting/Amber%20Club.html">Amber Club</a> even after he expressed misgivings about the place. Was interesting to watch, though!</li>
<li>Star: Was glad to see the pack (or least <a href="../Setting/Paca.html">Paca</a>) become more aware of <a href="../Setting/Wren.html">Wren</a>'s situation with Broken Mirror, even if only slightly.</li>
<li>Wish: Still know want to know more about what happened with <a href="../Setting/Alex%20Cecil.html">Alex Cecil</a> prior to his episode in the Shadow. I'm guessing his PTSD symptoms are from Lunacy? Is there a way that <a href="../Setting/Dade.html">Dade</a> might help him with that?</li>
<li>Wish: Looking forward to hearing from our mole in <a href="../Setting/Lupus%20et%20Fidelis.html">Lupus et Fidelis</a> about what he was able to find out about <a href="../Setting/Sister%20Cathwulf.html">Sister Cathwulf</a>.</li>
